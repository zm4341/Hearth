# 10. Integration cards

This chapter documents the cards in the **Integrations** category of Hearth's
Add card picker. Each one is a window onto another plugin or another service:
Templater, Dataview, Datacore, Git, Jira, RSS, Weather, Markets, World tension,
Operon (four cards) and
the Plugin view card.

A card whose plugin is not installed is still listed in the picker, marked
*Needs Dataview* (or Git, Operon, and so on) with a one-click link to install
it. You can add the card anyway; it shows a prompt until the dependency arrives.

For the full catalogue of what Hearth integrates with, including things that are
not cards, see [chapter 14](14-integrations.md).

---

## New note from template

**What it shows:** a grid of buttons, each of which creates a note from one of
your Templater templates.

**Requires:** the [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)
community plugin.

This card does something Templater's own per-template commands cannot: **the
same template can feed three different folders from three different buttons**.
Each tile carries its own template, its own destination folder and its own
filename pattern.

Templater still does the templating. Your user scripts, `tp.system.prompt()`
dialogs and `tp.file.cursor()` placement all behave exactly as they do when the
template is run from Templater's own command.

### Per-tile settings

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Label* | The text on the tile |
| Template | The Templater template this tile runs, chosen from a picker. The picker lists the templates in Templater's own template folder |
| Folder | The folder the new note goes in. The vault root means "wherever Obsidian puts new notes" |
| *Filename* | The name, without the extension. Leave empty to let Templater name it |
| Open toggle | Whether the new note opens, or is filed away silently |

### Filename tokens

Filenames may use:

| Token | Substituted with |
| --- | --- |
| `{{date}}` | Today's date |
| `{{date:FMT}}` | Today's date in a moment.js format, for example `{{date:YYYY-MM}}` |
| `{{time}}` | The current time |
| `{{time:FMT}}` | The current time in a format, for example `{{time:HH-mm}}` |
| `{{prompt}}` | Asks you for the rest of the name before the note is made |

Everything inside the template itself — `<% tp.* %>`, your user scripts,
`tp.system.prompt()` — is Templater's own.

### Card-level settings

*Button sizing*, *Buttons across*, *Minimum button size* and *Auto-shift tiles
(beta)* behave as they do on the Links card; see
[chapter 6](06-arranging-cards.md).

If Templater is not enabled, the card says so and keeps its configuration, so
installing Templater later makes the tiles start working with nothing else to
change.

---

## Dataview query

**What it shows:** a Dataview query, rendered by Dataview's own live renderers.

**Requires:** the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
community plugin.

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Query type* | **Dataview query (DQL)** — TABLE, LIST or TASK — or **DataviewJS** |
| *Query* | The query itself, written exactly as it would be inside a fenced code block, without the fences |

Table columns rendered by this card are resizable.

An important limitation: the card runs with **no "current note"**. Global
queries work fully; queries written relative to `this.file` have no file to
resolve against.

DataviewJS runs arbitrary JavaScript with the `dv` API in scope. Only use code
you trust.

Example DQL: `TABLE file.mtime AS "Modified" FROM #project SORT file.mtime DESC`
Example DataviewJS: `dv.list(dv.pages('#project').file.link)`

The card refreshes as Dataview's index changes.

---

## Datacore query

**What it shows:** a Datacore query rendered as a live list, or a full Datacore
script rendering its own view.

**Requires:** the [Datacore](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore)
community plugin. Datacore is Dataview's successor.

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Query type* | **Datacore query**, or a script in **JSX**, **JS**, **TSX** or **TS** |
| *Query* | A Datacore query such as `@page and #project`. Hearth renders the matches as a live list of links |
| *Script* | A Datacore script, as inside a `datacorejsx` block without the fences. The `dc` API is in scope and the script returns the view to render |
| *Rows per page* | Page the generated list at this many rows. 0 shows every match at once |

As with Dataview, the card runs with no "current note", so global queries work
fully and file-relative ones have nothing to resolve against. Scripts run
arbitrary code; only use code you trust.

One card runs **one** query. If you paste several, the card says so rather than
guessing which you meant.

---

## Git

**What it shows:** your repository's branch, staged and changed files, unpushed
commits and recent log, with working buttons.

**Requires:** the [Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) community
plugin, with a repository set up.

The Git card is a window onto the Git plugin rather than a second Git client.
Commits go through the Git plugin's own task queue, so your remote, your
credentials and your commit-message template all apply unchanged.

### Sections and buttons

*Sections* chooses which parts of the card are drawn. *Buttons* is a list you
build: commit, sync, push, pull, stage, discard and so on. Each button can be
removed and new ones added. *Button style* is **Icon only** (compact) or **Icon
and label** (readable on a wide card).

Buttons that discard work are marked as such: "Cannot be undone."

### Committing

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *What to commit* | **Staged if anything is staged, otherwise everything**, **Everything**, or **Only staged files** |
| *Ask for a message* | Have the Git plugin prompt for a commit message each time, exactly as its "…with specific message" commands do |
| *Commit message* | Used by this card's commit buttons. Leave empty to use the Git plugin's own commit-message template. Supports `{{date}}` |
| *Skip confirmations* | Run discarding actions immediately instead of asking first. Discarded changes cannot be recovered |

### Display

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Changed files shown* | 0 lists every changed file |
| *Show folders* | Print each changed file's folder under its name |
| *Commits shown* | How many recent commits the log section lists |
| *Re-read every* | Minutes between extra reads of the repository, on top of following the Git plugin's own updates. 0 — the default — follows those updates only, which already covers everything done inside Obsidian |

Per-file diffs are available from the card.

---

## Jira filter

**What it shows:** issues from a saved Jira filter or a JQL search.

**Requires:** a Jira Cloud or Jira Server instance reachable over HTTPS, and a
personal access token.

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Jira host* | The Jira site origin, for example `https://jira.example.com`. HTTPS is required when sending a personal access token |
| *Personal access token* | A bearer PAT used for this card. Stored in Hearth's plugin data |
| *API base path* | A relative Jira REST path such as `/rest/api/latest`. Full URLs are rejected |
| *Saved filter* | Load your favourite Jira filters, then choose one |
| *Filter controls* | Which controls the card offers for narrowing the list |
| *Max results* | The most issues to show, up to 200 |
| *Auto-refresh (minutes)* | How often to refresh. 0 refreshes only when the card is opened or refreshed by hand |
| *Cache interval (minutes)* | How long successful Jira responses stay in memory. 0 disables caching |

Issues can be filtered by status, assignee, priority, type, sprint and version.

Favourite filters cannot be loaded while *Disable external calls* is on, and the
card says so. If loading fails, check the host, the API path and the token.

**The personal access token is never included in an export.** See
[chapter 16](16-sharing-and-gallery.md).

---

## RSS feed

**What it shows:** headlines from any RSS 2.0 or Atom feed, with what you have
read and what you haven't — and a reader to read them in without leaving
Obsidian.

**Requires:** network access.

### Feeds

Each feed has an optional name and a URL. There is also an **Add from GitHub**
helper: enter a repository as `owner/repo`, or paste its URL, choose
**Releases**, **Commits** or both, and Hearth builds the Atom feed URLs for you.

*Combined "All" tab* adds a leading tab that merges every feed into one stream,
newest first.

### Display

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Layout* | **List** (title and date), **Cards** (excerpt and image), or **Compact** (headlines) |
| *Items per feed* | How many recent items to show |
| *Auto-refresh (minutes)* | How often to refetch. 0 fetches only when opened |
| *Show images* | Show item thumbnails when the feed provides them |
| *Show excerpt* | Show a short text snippet under each item |
| *Show date* | Show each item's publish time |

With external calls disabled, the card says *Feeds are off (external calls
disabled)* rather than failing silently.

### Read and unread

An entry is read once you open it, in the reader or the browser. Unread entries
carry a dot, and each feed's tab says how many it has. Above the list:

- the **filter** button lists only unread entries (also *Unread only* in the
  card's settings);
- **mark all as read** clears the feed shown;
- right-click an entry for every other action: read it in Hearth or in a new
  tab, open it in the browser, mark it read or unread, save it as a note, copy
  its link.

What has been read is kept in Hearth's settings, so it syncs with them.

### Reading in Hearth

Clicking an entry opens its web page by default. An entry with no web page —
an email newsletter brought into a feed by LetterFeed, Kill the Newsletter or
FreshRSS, say — opens in Hearth's **reader** instead, showing the full text the
feed carried. *Open entries in* can send every entry there: **Reader (dialog)**
over the board, or **Reader (tab)** in a tab of its own.

The reader shows the card's feeds along the top, the entries down the side and
the entry itself at a comfortable reading width, with buttons to open it in the
browser, save it as a note, mark it unread and copy its link. **←** **→** (or
**j** **k**) step through the entries, **[** **]** through the feeds; **o**
opens the page, **s** saves the note, **u** marks it unread, **i** loads its
pictures and **l** shows or hides the list. The dialog's tab button moves it
into a tab, where the tab's back and forward buttons walk the entries you read.

The feed's HTML is sanitised: scripts, frames and forms are dropped, links open
in your browser, and colours and fonts follow your theme.

*Pictures in the reader* decides about an entry's pictures. They are fetched
from the sender's server, which learns that you opened the entry — newsletters
count on it — so by default (**Ask**) the reader holds them back and offers
*Load pictures*. **Always load** and **Never load** do what they say. Tracking
pixels are never loaded, and nothing is while external calls are disabled.

### Save as note

*Save as note* in the reader turns an entry into a note through a note
template — the same kind the calendars' event notes use, described in
[Creating a note from an event](08-cards-planning.md#creating-a-note-from-an-event).
An entry offers `{{title}}`, `{{link}}`, `{{content}}` (the full text as
Markdown), `{{excerpt}}`, `{{published}}`, `{{author}}`, `{{feed}}`,
`{{feedUrl}}`, `{{categories}}` (a list), `{{image}}`, `{{id}}` and `{{html}}`.

Out of the box a note looks like a Web Clipper clipping: `source`, `author`,
`feed`, `published`, `created` and `tags: rss` as properties, the article as
the body. The preview is filled from the card's newest entry. Once saved, the
reader's button opens the note instead.

---

## Weather

**What it shows:** current conditions and a forecast, in seven styles up to a
full painted sky — plus tonight's moon and the sun's path across the day.

**Requires:** network access. Forecasts come from
[Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) — free, key-less, no account. Only the
coordinates you pick are ever sent.

### Location

You can find a place by name — Hearth stores the coordinates on the card, so the
lookup happens once — or type latitude and longitude in decimal degrees
yourself. There is also a *Reuse a location* picker offering places already set
on your other weather cards, and a *Label* for what the card calls the place.

Place search is unavailable while external calls are disabled; entering
coordinates by hand still works.

### Style

| Style | What it draws |
| --- | --- |
| *Minimal* | A glyph and a temperature |
| *Compact* | One row |
| *Detailed* | A grid of metrics |
| *Forecast* | An hourly curve |
| *Artistic* | An edge-to-edge painted sky that follows the real conditions and time of day |
| *Moon* | Tonight's moon in its real phase on a night sky, with how much of it is lit, the next full and new moon, and today's moonrise and moonset |
| *Daylight* | The sun on a parabola from sunrise to sunset, the time of the next sunset (or sunrise) and how long until it, and the day's length |

*Design* chooses **Classic** — line icons and the painted sky — or **Expressive**, in
Material 3 Expressive's manner: flat weather drawings (the big one on a cookie
shape), feels-like, high / low and metrics as chips, the hours as pills, thick
range bars, metric tiles with round badges, heavy type, and on *Artistic* the flat
illustrated sky. The interface parts take tonal steps of your accent colour; the
weather drawings and the sky take their colours from the weather. Every style
follows the board's or vault's *Design* ([chapter 11](11-appearance.md)) except *Moon*
and *Daylight*, which start Expressive; set them to
Classic for a shaded moon on a night-sky gradient and a rayed sun trailing a
gradient along a dashed arc.

*Moon* has a *Layout* setting: *Full* (the moon with its name, the month's
slider and the next full and new moon, moonrise and moonset) or *Clean* (just the
moon on its turning shape and the slider, with the phase as the hover text).

*Moon* and *Daylight* make no extra request: the moon is worked out on your
device from the time and the card's coordinates, and the sun's arc from the
forecast's sunrise and sunset. Both use the place's own clock. On them, *What to
display* offers only the place name, last updated and — on *Daylight* — the
condition, shown as a small glyph and temperature.

*Animate the sky* adds drifting clouds, falling rain and twinkling stars; on
*Moon* the moon rising into place, its shape turning and the slider filling, and
on *Daylight* the sun walking its arc up to the hour. It is always off in low
power mode.

Clicking a card opens the full forecast, hour by hour.

### Units

Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit; wind speed in km/h, m/s, mph or knots;
precipitation in millimetres or inches; time in 12-hour, 24-hour or automatic
(locale) format.

### What to display

Individually switchable: place name, condition, feels-like, today's high and
low, humidity, wind, precipitation (chance of rain, how much has fallen, and
per-hour chances), UV index, pressure, sunrise and sunset, and last updated.

*Hours ahead* sets how many hours the hourly strip covers (0 hides it) and *Days
ahead* how many days the daily forecast covers (0 hides it). *Auto-refresh
(minutes)* sets how often the forecast is refetched; 0 fetches only when opened.

### The weather sky as a background

The same painted sky can be used as the whole board's background, which is a
separate feature described in [chapter 11](11-appearance.md). A sky pinned to
one fixed condition needs no location at all and never goes online.

---

## Markets

**What it shows:** prices and moves for stocks, ETFs, funds, indices, forex
pairs and crypto — one instrument or many, a portfolio, or a search field right
on the card.

**Requires:** network access. Quotes come from free, key-less sources, none of
them an official API: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) for most of the
world's exchanges, forex, crypto and futures; [Tencent](https://gu.qq.com) for
Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing and Hong Kong listings, on-exchange funds among
them; [Eastmoney](https://fund.eastmoney.com) for Chinese off-exchange (OTC)
funds, valued through the day; [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com) for any
coin it lists; and the ECB's daily rates via
[Frankfurter](https://www.frankfurter.app/). Only the symbols on your cards,
and what you type into a search, are sent.

### Symbols

Search by name or symbol and press *Add* — a search asks every source that
could know the answer, and a Chinese name or a mainland code asks Tencent first.
Or type a symbol and *Add as typed*; the card works out where it trades:

| Typed | Fetched as |
| --- | --- |
| `AAPL`, `SAP.DE`, `^GSPC`, `GC=F` | Yahoo, as typed |
| `510300`, `sh510300`, `159915` | Tencent, then Yahoo (`510300.SS`) |
| `600519.SS`, `0700.HK` | Yahoo, then Tencent |
| `EUR/USD`, `EURUSD=X` | Yahoo forex, then the ECB |
| `BTC-USD`, `BTC/USD` | Yahoo |
| `fund:161725` | Eastmoney (an OTC fund's running estimate) |
| `cg:bitcoin`, `cg:bitcoin/eur` | CoinGecko |
| `fx:USD/CZK` | The ECB only |

Every instrument that more than one source carries has a fallback: if one
source fails, the card asks the next, and remembers which one answered. That is
what keeps a mainland board working where Yahoo is unreachable.

The arrows reorder the list; one-instrument styles show the first.

### Style

| Style | What it draws |
| --- | --- |
| *Minimal* | The price and its move |
| *Spotlight* | Name, price, move, a chart with a range switcher (1D to 5Y), the day's and the 52-week range, open, previous close and volume. With several instruments, chips along the top switch between them |
| *Chart* | The chart edge to edge, with the price laid over it |
| *Watchlist* | One row each, with a sparkline |
| *Tiles* | A grid of tiles |
| *Ticker tape* | A scrolling tape; it pauses under the pointer, and sits still (scroll it by hand) when *Scroll the tape* is off or the performance tier is reduced |
| *Portfolio* | The total value in one currency, today's and the overall gain, an allocation bar, and each holding's value and gain. Set *Units* and *Average cost* per symbol; symbols without units are listed as watched |
| *Lookup* | A search field over the card's watchlist: look anything up, see its chart and stats, and add it with one click |

*Design* chooses **Classic** or **Expressive** — the weather card's two — or
follows the board's or vault's *Design*. In
Expressive the move sits on a pill in its own colour, the single-instrument
styles set a trend glyph on a cookie shape, chips and rows become tonal
containers in your accent colour, tiles are tinted by their move and the chart
is drawn heavier.

*Rising colour* is green for a rise in most of the world and red in China,
Japan and Korea. *Automatic* follows Obsidian's language.

*Chart range* sets the span of the sparklines, or the range the spotlight and
chart styles open on. *Show the move as* a percentage, an amount, or both.

A portfolio's *Portfolio currency* is the one its totals are converted into, at
the ECB's daily rates; *Automatic* picks the currency most holdings are in. A
holding in a currency the ECB doesn't quote is left out of the totals, and the
card says so. London prices quoted in pence are counted in pounds.

Clicking an instrument opens it in full: a chart over any range with a
crosshair, the day's and the year's range, the stats, where the quote came from
and when, your position if the card holds some, and a link to the instrument's
page on the web.

### What to display and refresh

Names, sparklines, the spotlight's stats, whether the market is open, and when
the quotes were fetched are individually switchable where a style shows them.

*Refresh every (minutes)* defaults to 5; 0 fetches only when the board opens.
Quotes are shared by every card on every board, so ten cards watching the same
fund make one request, and a market that has closed is checked at most every
half hour.

**When publishing a board**, the units and costs on a portfolio are removed with
the other private details (see [chapter 16](16-sharing-and-gallery.md)); the
symbols travel.

---

## World tension

**What it shows:** [Kagi News](https://kite.kagi.com)' World Tension index — a
score from 0 (calm) to 100 (on fire) that Kagi's language model gives the day's
world headlines — with its band: *Cool* up to 20, *Mild* up to 40, *Warm* up to
60, *Hot* up to 80 and *Burning* above.

It is a model's assessment of the news, not a measurement, and the card says so
wherever it shows the model's words. Clicking the card opens the index on Kagi
News, with the reasoning and the history.

**Requires:** network access. The index comes from `kite.kagi.com`, free and
key-less; nothing about you or your vault is sent.

### Style

| Style | What it draws |
| --- | --- |
| *Minimal* | A thermometer, the score and its band, over a five-band scale with the score marked on it |
| *Artistic* | An edge-to-edge diorama of one village, drawn five ways: a spring morning with a turning windmill and grazing sheep (*Cool*); clouds and a watchtower on the hill (*Mild*); an amber overcast with an army camp, a parked tank and barbed wire (*Warm*); a red dusk with tanks on the move, jets, searchlights and the first house alight (*Hot*); and night, with a bomber over the village, flak, explosions and ruins (*Burning*) |

Both styles follow the card's *Design*: **Classic** draws a thin score, a slim
scale and a painted diorama with gradients and glows; **Expressive** sets the
thermometer on a cookie shape, the band on a chip, a chunky scale, and draws the
diorama in flat tonal shapes. *Animate* (artistic only) lets the windmill, the
smoke and the planes move; the performance tier and reduced motion can still
hold it still. On a card taller than it is wide, the diorama stands on the
bottom edge and its sky fills the card above.

### What to display and refresh

- **Band** — the band's name. On by default.
- **AI explanation** — what Kagi's model wrote about why the score is where it
  is: its first sentence, or all of it. Off by default. Hovering the card shows
  all of it either way.
- **Scale** (minimal) — the five-band scale.
- **Change since yesterday** — how many points the score moved since the day
  before, red when tension rose.
- **History** — a sparkline of the last 7 to 90 days, on the whole 0–100 scale.
- **Last updated** — when Kagi last scored the news.

Kagi publishes a new index once a day and says when it scored the current one,
so until a day has passed since then a card asks nothing at all. After that,
*Check every (minutes)* — 60 by default, never under 15 — is how often it looks
until the new index is in; 0 checks only when the board opens. Every card on
every board shares one request.

In terminal mode the card is the score in big digits in its band's colour, the
scale as a row of cells, and the same optional lines as text.

---

## The four Operon cards

**What they show:** four different views onto [Operon](https://github.com/hasanyilmaz/operon):
a **task list**, a **status board** (Operon's pipeline statuses as columns), an
**agenda** covering the next few days, and the running **timer**.

**Requires:** the Operon plugin, desktop only, Obsidian 1.12.2 or newer, and an
approval step inside Operon. See [chapter 14](14-integrations.md) for the
connection setup, which is the one integration that needs an action from you.

All four read through Operon's own in-process Developer API, so recurrence,
statuses, priorities and completion stay Operon's to define. Hearth never parses
Operon's notes.

### Common settings

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *View* | Task list, Status board, Agenda or Timer |
| *Scope* | Use one of Operon's own scoped views — *All tasks*, *Happening today*, *Overdue*, *Recently touched* — or **Custom filters** |
| *Tasks shown* | Maximum tasks in the list, or per board column |
| *Days ahead* | Agenda only: how many days it covers, including today |
| *Sort* | **Smart (date, priority, age)**, **Date**, **Priority**, **Created** or **Alphabetical**, with a direction toggle. Open tasks always come before completed ones |

Handing the question to one of Operon's own scopes means Operon decides what
counts as overdue or happening today, so the card stays correct as Operon's own
rules evolve.

### Custom filters

With *Scope* set to **Custom filters**, the card filters by *Pipelines*,
*Statuses*, *Priorities*, *Completion* (Open, Done, Cancelled — open only by
default) and a free-text *Text match* against the task description. Selecting
nothing in a picker means "all".

The pickers are populated from what Operon actually has, so a card added before
the connection is live shows *Add an Operon card to the board first to load
these options*.

### What each task row shows

Individually switchable: dates, priority, status, a recurring marker, a running
timer marker, a pinned marker, and the note name.

Clicking a task opens its note at the exact line.

### Making changes

Reading is the default. Writing is a choice, switched on at **Settings → Hearth
→ Integrations → Operon → Allow changes**.

With changes allowed:

- the board card lets you drag a task into another status column, or pick one
  from the row's right-click menu so it works without a mouse,
- every card grows a **+** that creates a task where Operon's own settings say
  new tasks go.

Hearth previews the change, Operon rates it and applies it, and anything more
than routine is confirmed with you first, in Operon's own words. A move carries
the status the board was drawn from, so a drag onto a stale board is refused
rather than quietly undoing someone else's change.

*New tasks* on the card chooses what the **+** asks Operon to make: **Operon's
default** (following Operon's own settings), **Inline, in a note**, or **Its own
note**. Where the task actually goes is Operon's decision either way. If Operon
is set to ask where each new inline task goes — which a dashboard card cannot
answer — the card tells you to choose *Its own note* instead.

### Empty and error states

The Operon cards are unusually explicit about why they are not showing anything:
*Enable the Operon plugin*, *The Operon integration is off*, *Operon's developer
API is desktop-only and needs Obsidian 1.12.2 or newer*, *Approve Hearth in
Settings → Operon → Core → General → Developer API Integrations*, *Operon
suspended Hearth's access*, *Operon access was revoked*, *Operon is still
starting up*, and *Operon refused the connection*, with Operon's own error text
shown underneath.

## Plugin view (beta)

**What it shows:** another plugin's registered side-panel view, hosted inside a
card — a calendar, an outline, a tag pane, a Kanban board.

**Requires:** any plugin that registers a view.

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *View to host* | A registered view from a core or community plugin. The list depends on which plugins are enabled |
| *File to show* | Optional. Open a specific vault file in the hosted view — an Excalidraw drawing, a canvas, a note. Leave empty to host the view without a file; some views then show a blank or "new file" screen |
| *Hide view header* | Hide the hosted view's own breadcrumbs, back/forward arrows and menu. Handy when the card shows a single file |

The card can also be pinned to one file, which is what makes it useful for a
specific drawing or PDF.

### The performance warning, in full

This is by far the heaviest card Hearth has. It runs another plugin's full view
live inside the dashboard, so it keeps that plugin's own timers, listeners and
rendering going for as long as the board is open, and **every one of these cards
costs again**. Use one or two at most, and expect a slower dashboard on modest
hardware.

Hearth's performance tier cannot slow this card down, because a hosted view
manages itself. If you have stepped the tier down and the dashboard still feels
heavy, this is the one card worth removing.

### Beta status

Some views expect to live in a sidebar and may render or size oddly inside a
card. If you want a hosted view at full size, consider a **plugin view
dashboard** instead, which gives the view the whole board; see
[chapter 5](05-dashboards.md).
