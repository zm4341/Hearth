# 7. Cards for notes and files

This chapter documents the Hearth cards in the **Notes & files** category of the
Add card picker. Every card is added the same way — press **Arrange** in the
Home view, press **Add card**, and pick it — and every card is configured from
its own gear button while arranging. See [chapter 6](06-arranging-cards.md) for
the mechanics.

The thirteen cards in this category are: Embedded note, Daily note, Periodic
note, Journal note, Embedded image, Slideshow, Embedded canvas, Excalidraw
drawing, Embedded base, Recent files, Folder, Favorites and Bookmarks.

---

## Embedded note

**What it shows:** any note in your vault, rendered live by Obsidian on the
dashboard.

**Requires:** nothing.

This is the workhorse card. The note is rendered by Obsidian itself, so
everything in it behaves as it does in a normal pane, and the card follows vault
events without losing your cursor.

### Options

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *File to embed* | A note, image, canvas or `.base` file in your vault. There is a file picker |
| *Zoom* | Scales the embedded content. Applies when you close the dialog |
| *Editable* | Edit the embedded note's text in place, saving to the vault. Markdown notes only |
| *Live preview* | Edit in Obsidian's own Live Preview editor instead of the plain raw-Markdown box, so formatting renders as you type. Off shows the raw Markdown source, edited on double-click |
| *Second file to embed* | Optional. When set, the card shows a switcher between the two views — in the header when the card has a title, or floating on hover when it does not |
| *Open button* | Show a button that opens the embedded file in its own tab. Off by default |

### Embedding a `.base` file

If the embedded file is a `.base`, two extra options appear:

- *Base view* — choose a named view from that `.base` file, or use its default
  view. Views whose names contain characters that cannot survive a wikilink are
  hidden, and the card tells you how many were hidden.
- *Hide base header* — hide the Bases view's own toolbar (its view switcher and
  filter/property controls) so that only the results show.

This requires Obsidian's core **Bases** plugin.

### Empty states

- *Pick a file to embed in settings* — no file chosen yet.
- *Enable the core Bases plugin to embed .base files*.
- *Enable the core Canvas plugin to embed canvases*.
- *Install the Excalidraw plugin to embed drawings*.

---

## Daily note

**What it shows:** always today's daily note. The note is created on first
click if it does not exist.

**Requires:** Obsidian's core **Daily notes** plugin.

Today's note is resolved from the Daily notes plugin's own date format and
folder, so it matches what the rest of your vault does. The card updates live as
you edit.

### Options

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Editable* | Edit today's note in place instead of read-only. Saves to the vault |
| *Open button* | Show a button to open today's note in the editor |

---

## Periodic note

**What it shows:** always the current week's, month's, quarter's or year's note.
Because it is always the *current* one, the card moves on by itself when the
period ends.

**Requires:** the [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes)
community plugin.

The note is resolved — and, if missing, created from your own template — by
Periodic Notes itself, so its folder, date format and template all apply. The
card updates live as you edit.

### Options

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Source* | Periodic Notes or Journals — see *Journal note* below |
| *Period* | Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly or Yearly |
| *Editable* | Edit the note in place instead of read-only |
| *Open button* | Show a button to open the note in the editor |

---

## Journal note

**What it shows:** the current note of one journal — whatever period that
journal writes. Like the Periodic note card it is always the *current* one, so
it moves on by itself when the period ends.

**Requires:** the [Journals](https://github.com/srg-kostyrko/obsidian-journal)
community plugin.

This is the same card as *Periodic note* with its *Source* set to Journals, and
you can switch an existing card between the two at any time.

The difference is what you choose. Periodic Notes has one weekly note, so that
card asks for a period; Journals lets a vault hold several journals of the same
cadence — a personal daily and a work daily, say — so this card asks for a
**journal by name** instead, and takes the period from the journal itself. That
also covers journals on a custom cadence, like every two weeks.

The note is resolved — and, if missing, created — by Journals itself through its
own plugin API, so its folder, name template, note template and creation prompts
all apply. The card updates live as you edit.

### Options

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Source* | Periodic Notes or Journals |
| *Journal* | Which journal to follow. The list comes from Journals |
| *Editable* | Edit the note in place instead of read-only |
| *Open button* | Show a button to open the note in the editor |

---

## Embedded image

**What it shows:** a picture from your vault, filling the card.

**Requires:** nothing.

This is the Embedded note card pointed at an image, with picture-specific
framing options.

### Options

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Picture fit* | *Original size*, *Fit the whole picture*, *Fill the card (crop)*, *Stretch to the card*, or *Fit the width (scroll)*. Every mode except *Original size* hands the picture the whole card, edge to edge |
| *Picture position* | Which of nine anchor points the picture sits at — top left, top, top right, left, center, right, bottom left, bottom, bottom right. When the fit is a crop, this decides which part of the picture the crop keeps |
| *Zoom* | Scales the picture inside the frame it was fitted to. Zooming a cropped picture crops in further |
| *Open button* | Show a button that opens the picture in its own tab |

---

## Slideshow

**What it shows:** pictures from a list you curate or from a folder, rotated on
a timer, once a day, or only by hand.

**Requires:** nothing.

### Choosing the pictures

*Pictures from* is either **A list of pictures** or **A folder**.

With a list, you add pictures one at a time, each with an optional caption, and
you can reorder and remove them. There is also an *Add a folder's pictures*
action that bulk-adds a folder's contents into the list.

With a folder, every image in that folder is shown, optionally including
subfolders. Leaving the folder empty means the vault root. The dialog tells you
how many images it finds there right now.

### Playback

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Order* | List order, Name A→Z, Name Z→A, Date created oldest or newest first, Date modified oldest or newest first, or Random |
| *Change picture* | **On a timer**, **Once a day**, or **Only by hand** |
| *Seconds per picture* | Timer mode only. 0 holds the first picture and turns rotation off |
| *Days per picture* | Daily mode only. 1 changes at midnight; 7 gives you a picture of the week |
| *Transition* | Cut (no animation), Crossfade, Slide or Zoom |
| *Transition length* | How long the transition takes, in milliseconds |
| *Slow zoom* | Drift slowly into each picture while it is shown — the "Ken Burns" effect |

The **Once a day** mode works its picture out from today's date rather than from
a running timer, so the picture stays put all day however often the board is
redrawn. Both daily and manual modes remember where they were left.

### Display

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Fit* | Fill the card (crop) or Fit the whole picture |
| *Controls* | Show previous / pause / next buttons and the position indicator, on hover. On by default |
| *Caption* | Show each picture's caption over it, falling back to its file name |
| *Pause on hover* | Hold the current picture while the pointer is over the card |
| *Open button* | Show a button that opens the picture on screen in its own tab |

Note that on the **Minimal** performance tier a slideshow holds one picture
instead of rotating; see [chapter 12](12-performance.md).

---

## Embedded canvas

**What it shows:** a canvas from your vault, interactive and edge to edge. You
can pan around it in place.

**Requires:** Obsidian's core **Canvas** plugin.

This is the Embedded note card pointed at a `.canvas` file.

---

## Excalidraw drawing

**What it shows:** an Excalidraw drawing, with native pan and zoom.

**Requires:** the [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)
community plugin.

Drawings render live. Hearth also exposes a *Create new Excalidraw drawing*
command and a mobile action button for it; both run Excalidraw's own "new
drawing" command rather than reimplementing it.

---

## Embedded base

**What it shows:** a `.base` file, rendered by Obsidian's own Bases.

**Requires:** Obsidian's core **Bases** plugin.

See *Embedding a `.base` file* under [Embedded note](#embedded-note) above for
the *Base view* and *Hide base header* options.

---

## Recent files

**What it shows:** the files you opened most recently.

**Requires:** nothing.

### Options

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Fit to card height* | List as many files as the card is tall enough to show, instead of a fixed number. Resizing the card then changes how many appear |
| *Number of files* | How many recently-opened files to list, when not fitting to height. There is a ceiling, which is as far back as Hearth's recent-file history goes |
| *File types* | Only list files of the selected types. Pick any combination; selecting none shows every type |

If you use Iconic or Iconize, each file shows its own icon here. See
[chapter 14](14-integrations.md).

---

## Folder

**What it shows:** what sits one level inside a folder — its subfolders and its
files — with a browser behind it for the rest.

**Requires:** nothing.

Clicking a file opens it. Clicking a subfolder opens the **folder browser** —
or walks the card itself into that folder, if you set it to. Clicking the card's
empty space or its folder button always opens the browser.

### Options

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| *Folder* | The folder the card lists. Leave it empty for the vault root; *Pick a folder* chooses one from a list |
| *Order* | How the contents are ordered — see below |
| *Show* | Folders and files, folders only, or files only. The browser follows the same choice |
| *Display* | A list of rows, or a grid of icon tiles |
| *Number of items* | How many the card lists before it says how many are left (it says so either way; with the browser off the count is not a way in). The browser is never capped |
| *Item counts* | Show how many things each subfolder holds |
| *Opening a subfolder* | In the folder browser (the default), or in the card itself |
| *Open the browser from the card* | Turn off for a card that should only ever open what it lists |
| *Open the browser* | In a dialog over the board (the default), or straight in a new tab |
| *Browser layout* | How the browser shows the folder, separately from *Display*: a list of rows, or larger tiles with a preview of each note |
| *Note previews* | With tiles: the first lines of each note's text on its tile. On by default |
| *Preview text size* | With previews: the size of that text, in pixels (6–14, 8 by default) |
| *Image previews* | With tiles: pictures show themselves, and a note shows its first embedded image as a cover. Full performance tier only. On by default |

### Order

*Same as the file explorer* is the default, and it means what it says: the card
asks the file explorer to order the folder, exactly as the sidebar does when it
draws it. The folder does not have to be open in the sidebar — or the sidebar
even visible — for this to work.

That includes a **custom order from a plugin**. A plugin that lets you drag the
sidebar into your own order — [Flexplorer](https://github.com/kh4f/flexplorer),
which the card was asked for, works this way — does it by replacing that same
ordering call, so its order is the answer the card gets, pinned items and all.
Reorder the sidebar and the card follows on its next redraw.

Two honest limits:

- If the explorer can't be read at all — no file explorer in this window, or a
  future Obsidian rearranges its internals — the card falls back to the sort the
  explorer is *set* to, so it still agrees with the sidebar's rule even when it
  can't get its order.
- A file a plugin **hides** rather than moves still appears on the card.
  Flexplorer hides by marking the row it has already ordered, so a hidden file
  is still in the order the card is given. Use *Show* if you need the card to
  leave things out.

The other orders are Hearth's own: name A–Z or Z–A, and modified or created,
newest or oldest first. Under those, folders lead and are sorted by name, the
way the file explorer does it — a folder has no modification time of its own for
a time sort to use.

Manual drag-and-drop ordering is not offered. Reordering a folder's contents by
hand is a file-explorer job, and a card that stored its own order would quietly
disagree with the sidebar the moment a file was added.

### Navigating in the card

Set *Opening a subfolder* to **In the card** and clicking a subfolder walks the
card into it instead of opening a dialog. The card then grows a path row: a back
arrow, and where you are, counted from the card's own folder. The arrow never
climbs above that folder — the card *is* that folder.

Where a card has been walked to is not part of the dashboard. It is not saved,
not synced to your other devices, and not carried in a shared dashboard: it is
where you are reading, not what the card is. It survives arranging the board,
switching dashboards and closing the tab, and resets to the card's own folder
when Obsidian restarts.

### The folder browser

The card is a glance; the browser is the whole folder. It opens as a dialog —
or in a tab, see below — with:

- a **breadcrumb** from the vault root down to the folder, every step of it
  clickable;
- the folder's **contents**, with each subfolder shown as its own section and
  opened one extra level, and the files between them gathered into blocks — so
  the page keeps the order the sidebar has, rather than sorting the folders away
  from the files;
- an **order** picker and a **list / tiles** switch, which belong to the
  browser: changing them there doesn't touch the card.

Each subfolder is a **panel** of its own, under a heading bar with its name and
how many things it holds. The chevron at the start of the heading **folds** the
panel down to the heading; a button beside the order picker folds every panel
on the page, or unfolds them all once they are all folded. Folds are shared by
every browser — the dialog and the tabs — and kept for the session, like where
you walked to. A folded panel reads nothing below its heading, so folding a
large subfolder also spares its previews.

Every folder in the browser — a breadcrumb step, a section heading, a row —
steps the dialog into that folder, so you can walk a whole tree without leaving
it.

Clicking a file opens it and closes the browser. **Ctrl/Cmd-clicking** one opens
it and leaves the browser where it is, for when you are picking several notes
into tabs rather than leaving to read one.

Either way the browser **reopens where you left it**, so a note opened out of a
folder five levels down doesn't cost you the walk back. Like the card's own
position, that is remembered for the session only, and a card set to navigate in
the card follows the browser: walk somewhere in the dialog, close it, and the
card is there.

#### In a tab

The dialog has a button at the end of its top row that moves the browser to a
**new tab**, where the folder has the whole page. Set *Open the browser* to
**In a new tab** and the card skips the dialog and opens the tab directly.

A tab behaves like any other page: walking into a folder is a step in the tab's
**back and forward** history, the tab reopens on the same folder after Obsidian
restarts, and it follows the folder live as notes are added, renamed or edited.
It has its own position — walking it doesn't move the card. Opening a folder
that already has a tab brings that tab forward instead of opening a second one.

The tab is drawn in the same design the dialog would be — Classic or
Expressive, from the card that opened it — and in terminal mode it is a
terminal page, in your colour scheme. It follows changes to those settings while
it is open.

#### Tiles and previews

Set *Browser layout* to **Tiles** — or use the switch beside the order picker —
and the browser shows larger tiles instead of rows: each note's name, then the
**first lines of its text**, small, the way a notes app shows a folder.

The preview is the note's text with its Markdown taken out — not rendered: no
properties, no code blocks, comments, embeds or images; headings, list items,
quotes and link labels as plain text. That keeps a page of tiles cheap. A note
is read only once its tile comes near the screen, so opening a large folder
doesn't read every note in it.

The text is deliberately small; *Preview text size* makes it larger. A CSS
snippet can also set `--hearth-folder-preview-size`.

With *Image previews* on, a picture's tile shows the picture, and a note whose
text embeds an image from the vault (`![[photo.jpg]]` or `![](photo.jpg)`)
shows the first one as a cover above its name. Images on the web are never
fetched for this. Pictures are shown **only on the Full performance tier**
(*Settings → Hearth → Behaviour*): Obsidian has no thumbnails, so every picture
is the whole file decoded and held in memory while the page is open — a folder
of phone photos is exactly what the lighter tiers, and the phone's Balanced
default, are there to spare. Like the text, a picture loads only once its tile
comes near the screen.

If you use Iconic or Iconize, files and folders show their own icons here. With
Front Matter Title, notes are listed by the titles the file explorer shows for
them. See [chapter 14](14-integrations.md).

---

## Favorites

**What it shows:** the notes you have starred in Hearth.

**Requires:** nothing.

Favorites are Hearth's own list, separate from Obsidian's Bookmarks.

By default every Favorites card shows one vault-wide list, which is edited from
the card's settings (*Add favorite*, plus move up, move down and remove).

A single card can be given a list of its own with *Give this card its own list*.
Turning it on starts from the list the card is showing now; turning it back off
drops the card's own list and returns it to following the vault-wide favourites.

---

## Bookmarks

**What it shows:** your Obsidian bookmarks, groups and all, with site favicons
for bookmarked URLs.

**Requires:** Obsidian's core **Bookmarks** plugin.

The card reads Obsidian's bookmarks directly, so anything you bookmark anywhere
in the app appears here, and it follows the list as you change it — a bookmark
added, renamed, removed or reordered shows up on the card without reopening the
tab.

Obsidian bookmarks five different things, and clicking a row opens each one
where it belongs:

| Bookmark | Clicking it |
| --- | --- |
| A **note** | Opens the note — at the heading or block you bookmarked, if you bookmarked one rather than the whole note |
| A **folder** | Opens Hearth's folder browser on that folder (the same browser the Folder card uses) |
| A **URL** | Opens it in your browser |
| A **search** | Hands the query to Obsidian's search pane |
| A **graph** | Opens the graph view with the settings that were saved with the bookmark |

A group is a collapsible header: clicking it folds and unfolds what's inside,
to any depth.

Saved searches and saved graphs need Obsidian's own **Search** and **Graph
view** core plugins switched on. If one is off, the card tells you which rather
than doing nothing.

Bookmarks whose target has been deleted are hidden, the same way Obsidian's own
bookmarks pane hides them.

---

## Common behaviour across these cards

**Where a clicked note opens** is governed by **Settings → Hearth → Behaviour →
Opening notes**. There is a general *Open notes in* choice and a per-source
override for *Notes in cards*, which covers the Recent, Bookmarks, Favorites,
Calendar, Heatmap and Tasks cards.

**Liveness.** Embedded and editable notes follow vault events without losing
your cursor. The Recent and saved-query cards update as the vault changes if
*Live refresh on vault changes* is on under **Settings → Hearth → Behaviour**.
Switching back to the Hearth tab always refreshes it regardless of that
setting. The Bookmarks card is the exception: bookmarks aren't a vault change,
so it follows the bookmark list itself and needs no setting.

**Headerless cards.** Leaving a card's *Title* empty draws it without a header
row. For image, slideshow, canvas and drawing cards this is usually what you
want: the picture then fills the card completely.
