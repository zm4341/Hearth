# Running a Hearth gallery

This is the operator's guide: what to do, in order, to have a dashboard gallery
that people can browse and publish to. The wire contract is
[`gallery-api.md`](gallery-api.md); the server itself lives in its own
repository, [ondreu/hearth-gallery](https://github.com/ondreu/hearth-gallery).

Everything below assumes you have cloned that repository and are at its root:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ondreu/hearth-gallery.git
cd hearth-gallery
```

The `--recurse-submodules` is not optional. The server bundles the plugin's own
package engine, and `vendor/hearth` is where it reads it from — pinned to a
released tag, so a gallery never serves packages the released plugin cannot
read. After a plain clone, `git submodule update --init --depth 1`.

---

## 1. Try it locally, in one command

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

That builds the server and starts it on `http://localhost:8787`, with its whole
state in one SQLite file inside a Docker volume. Check it:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8787/v1/info
```

Then, in Obsidian: **Settings → Hearth → Import / export → Dashboard gallery**,
and replace the address there with `http://localhost:8787` (the field arrives
holding the default gallery — see §8). Hearth allows plain `http` on a loopback
address for exactly this, so no certificate is needed to try it. The gallery
buttons — beside "Add card" in arrange mode, in the add-card picker's rail, and
on the setup wizard's first step — follow whatever address is saved.

Publish a board from **Share dashboard → Publish**, and it is there.

**No Docker?** Node 24 (or 22.5+ with `--experimental-sqlite`) and nothing else:

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
DB_PATH=./data/gallery.db node dist/index.js
```

The build produces one file with no dependencies. That is the whole deployment
artifact, and it is worth knowing: upgrading a gallery is copying a file.

---

## 2. Check it actually works

```sh
npm --prefix server run smoke                      # against localhost:8787
GALLERY_URL=https://gallery.example.com \
	npm --prefix server run smoke                  # against a deployed one
```

Sixty-five checks (two more against a gallery with a small per-author cap): signing in with a real key, publishing real signed packages,
refusing an unsigned one and an edited one, voting, downloading, withdrawing.
It mints a fresh identity per run, so it is safe to run against a live gallery
more than once — though it does publish two boards and leave one behind.

Raise `WRITES_PER_MINUTE` for the duration of a run, or the rate limiter will
(correctly) stop it half way through.

---

## 3. Put it on the internet

Three things have to be true, and only the first is about the gallery.

### TLS, from something in front

The server speaks plain HTTP and should never be the thing facing the internet.
Hearth refuses to talk to an `https`-less host anyway (outside loopback), so
this is not optional. Caddy is the shortest path:

```caddyfile
gallery.example.com {
	reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8787
	request_body {
		max_size 20MB          # above MAX_PACKAGE_BYTES, or uploads fail at the proxy
	}
}
```

nginx equivalent: `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8787;` with
`client_max_body_size 20m;`. The body limit is the one people forget — a
16 MiB package plus JSON overhead has to fit through the proxy as well as
through the server.

### Tell the server it is behind a proxy

```
TRUST_PROXY=1
```

**Only** once a proxy you control is actually in front of it. With it on, the
client address is read from `X-Forwarded-For`, a header anyone talking to the
socket sets for themselves. On a directly exposed server that turns every
per-address limit into a limit per string-they-typed, which is no limit at all.

With it off, per-address limits use the socket address — which behind a proxy is
the proxy, so every visitor shares one bucket. Getting this wrong in either
direction breaks rate limiting, which is the entire anti-abuse story. Get it
right.

### Don't publish the port

`docker-compose.yml` binds to `127.0.0.1:8787` on purpose. Leave it there and
let the proxy reach it; don't change it to `8787:8787` and then also run a
proxy.

## 4. Settings worth deciding

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change what you mean to. Every
value has a default and the server starts with none of them set. The ones that
are actually decisions:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `GALLERY_NAME` | what clients call your gallery. Set it. |
| `MAX_PACKAGE_BYTES` | the outer bound on an upload, default 16 MiB. The format's own caps (4 MiB per picture) still apply inside it. |
| `MAX_ENTRIES_PER_AUTHOR` | 50. A gallery is not a backup service. |
| `UPLOADS_PER_DAY` | 10 per identity. |
| `VOTES_PER_DAY`, `VOTES_PER_IP_PER_DAY` | 200 and 400. |
| `COMMENTS_PER_DAY`, `COMMENTS_PER_IP_PER_DAY` | 60 and 120. |
| `READS_PER_MINUTE`, `WRITES_PER_MINUTE` | 300 and 30, per address. |
| `VOTE_MIN_KEY_AGE_HOURS` | **0 — the dial to reach for first if you get a vote ring.** See below. |
| `TERMS_URL` | optional; shown to people as text. |

---

## 5. What you are actually signing up for

### Votes can be manufactured, and no setting fixes that

An identity is a key somebody's copy of Hearth generated. Keys are free to mint,
so identities are free, so votes are free. Nothing in this design is
Sybil-resistant and nothing you can add to the server makes it so.

What you have is friction:

- **per-address limits**, which are the ones that cost an attacker something;
- **`VOTE_MIN_KEY_AGE_HOURS`**, which makes a key wait before its votes count.
  It ships at 0 because a new gallery telling its first ten users to come back
  tomorrow is worse than the problem. Set it to 24 the day you need it — it
  costs an attacker a day per identity.

Say this in your terms rather than implying a robustness the mechanism doesn't
have. A vote count here means "some number of people who have Hearth installed",
not "some number of distinct humans".

### You are hosting other people's files

Every entry is a JSON file somebody uploaded, served to other people's vaults.
The server refuses a package that isn't signed, one whose signature doesn't
verify, one that isn't a single dashboard, one that still names its author's
folders or private feeds, and one whose embedded pictures are the wrong type or
over the caps. What it does **not** do — because nothing automated can — is
judge what a board is *for*, or what somebody writes in a comment on it.

Comments are the part most likely to need you. An entry has to be a signed,
stripped dashboard package to exist at all; a comment is a thousand characters
somebody typed. Their author can delete their own, and **a board's owner can
delete any comment on their board** — which handles most of it without you — but
the `comments` table is where to look when it doesn't.

A dashboard can name public URLs on purpose: an embedded page, an RSS feed, a
wallpaper given as a URL. Those are what the board *is*, so they travel, and
`remoteRefs` on every entry says how many there are. But it does mean a
published board can point at anything on the web. If your gallery grows past
people you know, you will want to look at what is in it.

The tools for that are in the database, which is one file:

```sh
# What is live, newest first
sqlite3 /var/lib/hearth/gallery.db \
	"SELECT id, name, category, remote_refs, published_at FROM entries WHERE status='live' ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 20;"

# Held for review — the strip's own backstop saw something path-shaped
sqlite3 … "SELECT id, name, hold_reason FROM entries WHERE status='held';"

# Take something down. `removed` is *your* status: the id is kept so it can
# never be reused, and the entry cannot be republished, so the takedown sticks
# even if its author uploads the identical package again.
#
# Not to be confused with `withdrawn`, which is what an author's own "Remove
# from the gallery" writes — that one they may undo by publishing again, which
# is theirs to do.
sqlite3 … "UPDATE entries SET status='removed', package='', wallpaper=NULL, snapshot=NULL WHERE id='…';"

# Recent comments, which are the only prose in the database somebody else wrote
sqlite3 … "SELECT c.id, c.created_at, c.body FROM comments c WHERE c.status='live' ORDER BY c.created_at DESC LIMIT 20;"
sqlite3 … "UPDATE comments SET status='removed', body='' WHERE id='…';"

# Release a held entry after looking at it
sqlite3 … "UPDATE entries SET status='live', hold_reason=NULL WHERE id='…';"

# An author asking why they cannot republish a board they withdrew before this
# build: their row says `removed`, which is now *your* status. Nothing is
# relabelled on upgrade, because doing so would have reversed real takedowns.
# Hand one back with:
sqlite3 … "UPDATE entries SET status='withdrawn' WHERE id='…';"
```

There is no admin UI, deliberately: an admin UI is an authentication surface,
and `sqlite3` over ssh is one you already have.

### Withdrawing is not deletion

Someone who installed a board keeps it. Nothing about publishing is retractable
from other people's vaults, and Hearth says so before anybody publishes.

---

## 6. Backups

The gallery is one SQLite file. Back that up and you have backed up everything —
entries, packages, wallpapers, votes, profiles.

```sh
# Safe while the server is running. Don't `cp` a live SQLite file.
sqlite3 /var/lib/hearth/gallery.db ".backup '/backups/gallery-$(date +%F).db'"
```

With Docker:

```sh
docker compose exec gallery \
	node -e "const{DatabaseSync}=require('node:sqlite');new DatabaseSync('/data/gallery.db').exec(\"VACUUM INTO '/data/backup.db'\")"
docker compose cp gallery:/data/backup.db ./gallery-backup.db
```

Restoring is putting the file back and starting the server. Migrations are
numbered and applied on startup, so an older file opened by a newer build
upgrades itself.

Two things are *not* in the database and don't need to be: nobody's private key
(they never leave their vaults) and no passwords (there aren't any). What a
stolen copy of this file gives someone is a list of public keys, which are
public, and everything already published.

---

## 7. Upgrading

```sh
git pull --recurse-submodules
docker compose up -d --build
```

The container is stateless; the volume is the state. Migrations run on startup.
Take a backup first anyway.

---

## 8. The default gallery

`DEFAULT_GALLERY_URL` in `src/gallery/client.ts` is empty in this build, so no
install points at a gallery until somebody types an address into *Settings →
Hearth → Backup → Gallery address*. A vault still holding the host upstream
Hearth used to seed (`UPSTREAM_GALLERY_URL`) is switched off when it loads.

- **Nothing is fetched until somebody opens it.** Configuring a host draws the
  buttons; it does not make a request. A vault that never opens the gallery
  never talks to it.
- **A chosen host stays.** `migrateSettings` keeps whatever address a vault
  stored across upgrades.

Shipping a build that points at a gallery out of the box is that one constant.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"That isn't an address Hearth will talk to."** `https`, or `http` on
localhost. Not an `http` host on the network — including `http://192.168.…`,
which is the common one.

**"That address answered, but not like a Hearth gallery."** `GET /v1/info`
didn't come back with `api: 1`. Usually a proxy serving something else at that
path, or a trailing path prefix Hearth kept and the proxy strips.

**Uploads fail at ~1 MB.** The reverse proxy's body limit, not the server's.
See the Caddy/nginx snippets above.

**"The picture of the board is too large."** A snapshot over 1 MiB. Hearth
writes ~900px JPEGs at quality 70, which land far below that, so this means a
different client — or a package edited by hand.

**Every visitor shares one rate-limit bucket.** `TRUST_PROXY` is off behind a
proxy. Set it to 1.

**One visitor can exhaust everyone's bucket.** `TRUST_PROXY` is on without a
proxy. Set it to 0.

**`SQLite is an experimental feature`** on Node 22. Expected; `node:sqlite` is
stable from Node 24, which is what the Docker image uses.

**A publish is refused with "still names N things from its author's vault".**
The uploader published without the strip. In Hearth's own publish path that
can't happen — it is pinned on — so this means a different client, or a
hand-made file.
