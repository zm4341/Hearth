# Changelog

All notable changes to Hearth are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
(`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) as required by Obsidian's plugin manifest. Beta builds are
tagged `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-beta.N` and are omitted here; each entry aggregates its
preceding beta series.

History begins at 1.5.0. For releases before 1.5.0, see the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ondreu/Hearth/releases) page.

## [3.4.0]

### Added

- **Terminal mode (experimental).** A third design beside Classic and
  Expressive (**Settings → Hearth → Appearance → Terminal**, and in the setup
  wizard's look step) that draws the whole of Hearth as a text interface, the
  way a terminal tool such as `htop` looks: one character grid in a bundled
  monospaced font, every card a box drawn in line characters that joins its
  neighbours, and keys for everything.
  - Cards keep their places on the board, rounded to the grid; a narrow pane
    stacks them in one column. Tab moves between cards, the arrows move inside
    one, Enter opens, Space ticks or folds, `m` opens the card menu, `z` zooms
    the card to the size of a dialog, and F1–F10 run the board (help,
    arrange, search, filter, refresh, sort, add, board settings, colours,
    quit). Arranging works by keys (arrows move, Shift and an arrow resizes)
    or by dragging a frame and its corner.
  - The boards are tabs along the top, like tmux windows: `1`–`9` open one,
    `[` and `]` step through them all, and when there are more than the line
    holds it shows those around the active board, with a count on each side
    that has more — click it to list every board.
  - Every card with a text form is drawn as text: tasks as an htop table or a
    board, notes as highlighted Markdown you can tick and edit in place, the
    calendars as `cal` and a time grid, the weather as ASCII art with the full
    forecast when zoomed, markets as tables and block-character charts, Git as
    `git status`, folders and bookmarks as trees, a Dataview table as a table,
    the pet as its sprite in half blocks. Pictures, web pages, hosted views,
    Datacore and DataviewJS are drawn graphically inside their frame.
  - Emoji are replaced by ASCII where there is an equivalent and left out where
    there isn't. Hearth's dialogs, menus and settings follow the same look.
  - Five colour schemes (your Obsidian theme's colours, Htop, Hearth, Amber,
    Paper) and a font size. Switching terminal mode off brings every board
    back exactly as it was.
  - Settings that would change nothing while terminal mode is on are hidden
    until it is switched off: a card's Style tab and button sizing; the board
    dialog's Style and Background tabs, the header's icon, alignment and sizes,
    and the width; the wallpaper, card surfaces and compact spacing; designs
    and animations of the weather and market cards, picture and icon options,
    pixel sizes, live preview and open buttons on notes. Vault-wide settings
    stay while a plugin board, which terminal mode leaves as it is, still uses
    them.
- **Single-card dashboards.** A third *Dashboard type* beside Cards and Plugin
  view: **Single card** gives the whole board to one of its own Hearth cards —
  an RSS reader, a task list — at full size, the way a plugin view fills its
  board. Pick the card on the board's new **Card** tab (or add one there); a
  pencil on the switcher row opens the card's settings. The board keeps all of
  its cards, so switching back to Cards puts them back where they were.
- **An RSS reader inside Hearth** (#377). Entries open in a reader — a large
  dialog over the board, or a tab of its own — with the card's feeds along the
  top, the entries down the side and the entry at a reading width. Arrow keys
  (or j/k) step through the entries and `[` `]` through the feeds; buttons open
  the page in the browser, save the entry as a note, mark it unread and copy
  its link, and the dialog moves into a tab with one click. **Open entries in**
  on the card chooses the browser (the default), the dialog or the tab; an
  entry with no web page — an email newsletter brought in through LetterFeed or
  FreshRSS — always opens in the reader. Drawn in all three designs.
  - The feed's HTML is sanitised; links open in the browser, colours and fonts
    follow the theme, and pictures wait for **Load pictures** by default, since
    a remote picture tells its sender the entry was opened (**Pictures in the
    reader**: Ask, Always, Never). Tracking pixels never load, nor does
    anything while external calls are off.
  - **Read and unread.** Opened entries count as read; unread ones carry a dot
    and each feed's tab its unread count. A filter button (and **Unread only**
    in the settings) lists only the unread, another marks the feed read, and
    right-clicking an entry offers every action. In terminal mode `u` toggles
    an entry, `A` marks the feed read and `f` filters. Read marks live in
    Hearth's settings, so they sync with them.
  - **Save entries as notes**, through a note template like the Obsidian Web
    Clipper's: a note name, a folder, typed properties (text, list, number,
    checkbox, date, date & time) and a body, each taking `{{variables}}` and
    filters (`{{published|date:"D MMMM YYYY"}}`, `{{title|lower|truncate:40}}`,
    `{{categories|wikilink|join}}`). The editor lists the variables — click one
    to insert it — and the filters, and previews the note from the card's
    newest entry. Saved entries open their note instead. Entries now carry
    their author and categories for templates.
- **The folder browser in a tab of its own** (#375). A button in the folder
  browser's top row moves it from the dialog to a new tab, where the folder has
  the whole page; a Folder card set to *Open the browser → In a new tab* opens
  it there directly.
  - Walking into a folder is a step in the tab's back and forward history, the
    tab reopens on the same folder after a restart, and it follows the folder
    live. Opening a folder that already has a tab brings that tab forward.
  - The tab takes the dialog's design — Classic or Expressive from the card
    that opened it, and terminal mode in its colour scheme — and follows
    changes to them while it is open.
- **Tiles with note previews in the folder browser** (#375). The browser gets
  its own layout, separate from the card's: a list, or larger tiles that show
  each note's name and the first lines of its text — small by default, with a
  size setting — without its properties, code blocks or embeds. A switch
  beside the order picker changes the layout on the spot. A note is read only
  once its tile comes near the screen.
  - Each subfolder is a panel of its own under a heading bar, and folds down
    to its heading from the chevron at its start; a button in the top row
    folds or unfolds them all. Folds last for the session.
  - On the Full performance tier, pictures show themselves on their tiles and
    a note shows its first embedded image as a cover (*Image previews*, on by
    default). Lighter tiers skip them: there are no thumbnails, so each one is
    the whole picture decoded.
- **Front Matter Title integration** (#375). With the
  [Front Matter Title](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-front-matter-title-plugin)
  plugin's file-explorer feature on, Folder cards and the folder browser list
  notes by the titles the explorer shows instead of their file names, through
  the plugin's own API. On by default; **Settings → Hearth → Integrations →
  Front Matter Title** turns it off.
- **World tension card.** Kagi News' World Tension index — a language model's
  0–100 reading of the day's world news, from *Cool* to *Burning* — on the
  board, in the Integrations section of the card picker.
  - *Minimal* shows the score and its band on a five-band scale; *Artistic*
    paints a village that goes from a spring morning to a night at war as the
    score climbs: sheep and a turning windmill, then a watchtower, an army
    camp, tanks and jets, and above 80 a bomber over the ruins.
  - Both styles come in Classic and Expressive, and terminal mode draws the
    card as text.
  - The model's explanation (first sentence or all of it), the change since
    yesterday, a sparkline of up to 90 days and the time of the last update
    are optional. Clicking the card opens the index on Kagi News.
  - The index comes from `kite.kagi.com`, free and key-less, and **Disable
    external calls** stops it like every other request. Kagi publishes it once
    a day, so a card asks nothing until the next one is due, then checks
    hourly (by default) until it arrives.
- **Hearth speaks French.** A full `fr` locale joins English, German and
  Simplified Chinese: every string Hearth draws comes out in French when
  Obsidian's own display language is French, with no setting of its own.
  Anything untranslated falls back to English. Thanks to @jlclux71 (#374).
  - The search bar's instant answers understand French phrases too:
    `LVMH en bourse`, `météo Paris`, `pile ou face`, `lancer 2d6`,
    `nombre aléatoire 1-10`, `jours jusqu'au 2026-12-24`,
    `aujourd'hui + 45 jours`, `vendredi prochain`, `heure à Tokyo` and French
    city names. The calculator reads `en` as "to" (`100 euros en dollars`,
    `10 km en miles`), `20 % de 150`, and `binaire`, `décimal` and
    `hexadécimal`. The search tips show French examples.

### Changed

- **Event notes use note templates.** The calendars' "Create note" is set up
  the same way as a saved feed entry — name, folder, typed properties and body,
  with variables, filters and a live preview — instead of per-field routing
  rules. Cards set up the old way convert to the equivalent template and make
  the same notes; `{{field:FORMAT}}` placeholders keep working.
- **RSS feed tabs fit any card.** A tab is as wide as its feed's name instead
  of a fixed width that cut names short; a row with more feeds than room
  scrolls sideways (the mouse wheel too), fades at the edge with more beyond
  it, keeps the open feed in view, and ends in a "+N" button listing every
  feed. The reader's feed row works the same way.
- **The card gallery fits a phone.** At 620px and narrower, its category rail
  becomes a dropdown.
- *Mobile mode (search only)* is marked **Legacy** in the settings.

### Fixed

- **Phone fixes from a mobile review** (#370):
  - Card and dashboard settings no longer let the footer sit over the rows in
    the middle of the list; on a phone the footer is pinned to the bottom.
  - Markets cards on a phone send requests Yahoo accepts; it refused the ones
    Obsidian's mobile HTTP client sent, the likely cause of "Unavailable".
  - Date fields in the task dialog and the Operon card keep room for the
    calendar icon Obsidian pins to their start.
  - The search bar's results close when you tap or scroll outside them.
  - Live-preview note cards (Daily note) and hosted views lose the ~84px gap
    Obsidian's phone header left at their top.
  - Toggles in Hearth's settings keep their own width at the end of the row
    instead of squeezing the setting's name.
- **Icon buttons keep their icons in Obsidian's tablet layout.** On a tablet
  or an unfolded foldable, Obsidian pads every button 20px on each side, so
  the dashboard switcher, the calendar and schedule arrows and other small
  icon buttons showed as empty pills, and the rest swelled to twice their
  width. They now keep the size they have on a phone or desktop
  ([#381](https://github.com/ondreu/Hearth/issues/381)).
- **Buttons on Launchpad, Commands and New note from template cards can be
  moved with a finger.** In arrange mode a touch drag on a button was taken
  for a scroll, so the button snapped back to where it was; only its resize
  corner worked. On a free-form board a button now follows the finger at once.
  On the stacked phone column, which still has to scroll, rest the finger on
  the button until it lifts, then drag. A drag the system interrupts (a
  notification, a system gesture) now puts the button back instead of
  dropping it in the card's top-left corner. The resize corner is also larger
  on touch screens.
- **`FF hex to decimal` in the search bar now answers.** The search tips
  suggest it, but a query without a digit never reached the calculator, so a
  hex number written only in letters got no answer unless typed after `=`.
- **RSS entries whose only address is their `<guid>` now open that page.**

## [3.3.0]

### Added

- **Instant answers in the search bar.** A query that has an answer of its
  own gets it above the notes:
  - sums and unit conversions — `1+1`, `20% of 150`, `10 km to mi`
  - currencies with the pair's chart — `20 CZK to EUR`, `20 euros in
    dollars`, `100 CHF nach EUR`, `20美元换成人民币`, `eur/usd`
  - market quotes with a chart — `$AAPL`, or by name: `apple stock`,
    `bitcoin price`, `Siemens Aktie`, `茅台股价`
  - the weather — `weather Prague`, `Wetter Berlin`, `北京天气`
  - Wikipedia summaries — `wiki Alan Turing`, `wiki:de Prag`, `维基 布拉格`
  - chance — `coin flip`, `roll 2d6`, `d20`, `random 1-10`
  - dates — `days until 2026-12-24`, `today + 45 days`, `Tage bis …`,
    `距离2026-12-24还有几天`
  - the time elsewhere — `time in Tokyo`, `Zeit in Prag`, `东京时间`

  Phrases work in English, German and Chinese; a leading `=` forces the
  calculator. Enter copies the answer, opens a quote or article, or rolls
  again; a date or a clock leaves Enter on the first note. Online answers are
  fetched only for queries that ask for them, reuse the calculator's, Markets
  and Weather cards' cached sources, and stop with **Disable external calls**.

  Each answer can be switched off vault-wide (**Settings → Search → Instant
  answers**), per board (*Dashboard settings → Header*) and per Search bar card.
  A board or card can only switch answers off, never back on, so an installed
  board can't turn on requests you have off.

- **Search tips.** One dialog lists everything the search bar understands —
  `#tags`, `key:value`, `>commands` and every instant answer — with examples
  that type themselves into the bar when clicked. Type `?` into any search
  bar, run **Hearth: Show search tips**, or open it from Settings → Search. An
  empty search bar offers it once after this update.

- **Checkbox tasks on the calendars.** Both calendar cards can now draw
  Markdown checkbox tasks (`- [ ] …`) by the dates written on them in the Tasks
  format — 📅 due and ⏳ scheduled — the way they already draw TaskNotes. Turn
  it on under **Checkbox tasks** in the card's settings; entries can be ticked
  off from the calendar and open the note at the task's line. Optionally limit
  it to some folders and pick its colours.

- **List or tiles for Favorites and Recent files** (#358). Both cards get a
  **Display** setting: *List* puts the icon beside the name, one row per file;
  *Tiles* draws the grid with the icon above it. Existing cards keep the look
  they had (tiles for Favorites, a list for Recent files); a newly added
  Favorites card starts as a list, like every other file-listing card. Tiles
  work with Recent files' **Fit to card height** too.

### Changed

- **The search results float more clearly above the board.** The dropdown
  casts a deeper two-layer shadow, denser in dark themes, and in the
  Expressive design takes Material 3's menu elevation with a tonal edge, so
  it no longer reads as sitting flat on the cards below.

- **The README has a Privacy & network section.** It lists every service
  Hearth can contact, what triggers each request and what is sent, and what
  Hearth does with your vault and clipboard.

### Fixed

- **No more sideways wobble on a phone with the Arrange button on hover.**
  The hidden button was nudged past the board's right edge, which left the
  whole board a few pixels wider than the screen and scrollable sideways
  (#326). It now fades and shrinks in place.

- **A fit-to-page board follows the pane as you resize it.** Its cards stayed
  at their old size until the pane edge stopped moving and then jumped into
  place. On the *Full* performance tier they now follow the resize frame by
  frame; the lower tiers keep the single re-fit at the end to save the work.

- **Disable external calls now covers bookmark icons too.** A URL bookmark's
  favicon was still fetched from Google's favicon service with the switch on.
  It now shows the globe icon instead.


## [3.2.0]

### Added

- **Material 3 Expressive: a second design for all of Hearth.** A new
  **Design** setting — *Classic* or *Expressive* — heads **Settings → Hearth →
  Appearance**. Expressive redraws everything Hearth draws in tonal steps of
  your accent colour, in light and dark themes:

  - **Cards** sit on an opaque tonal surface with large rounded corners that
    draw in on hover; cards snapped together read as one connected group.
    Inside, rows become grouped tonal lists with icons on round badges,
    controls become pills and button groups, and each card's headline is set
    heavy or on a cookie shape. Both calendars and the weather card follow in
    every view.
  - **Everything around the cards** — the board's search row and buttons,
    every dialog, picker and menu Hearth opens, and its settings pane, where
    rows are gathered into tonal groups under accent headings. Obsidian's own
    interface and other plugins' are left to your theme.

  The choice cascades vault → board → card, and a dialog or menu takes the
  design of whatever opened it. Cards showing your own content (notes, embeds,
  web pages) keep that content as it is and take only the frame. Card opacity,
  blur, corner radius and border shape Classic cards only, so they are hidden
  where no card is Classic. A shared or published board carries its designs.

- **A Markets card: stocks, funds, forex and crypto.** Type or search a symbol
  — `AAPL`, `0700.HK`, `510300`, `EUR/USD`, `BTC-USD`, `fund:161725` — and the
  card finds where it trades across Yahoo Finance, Tencent, Eastmoney,
  CoinGecko and the ECB. All are free and key-less; an instrument more than one
  source carries falls back to the next when one fails, so a mainland board
  keeps working where Yahoo can't be reached.

  Eight styles — *Minimal*, *Spotlight*, *Chart*, *Watchlist*, *Tiles*,
  *Ticker tape*, *Portfolio* (holdings, total in one currency, gains and an
  allocation bar) and *Lookup* — each Classic or Expressive. Rises are green or
  red by your language's convention. Clicking an instrument opens a chart over
  any range with its stats and your position. Publishing a board strips a
  portfolio's units and costs; the symbols travel (#337).

- **Moon and Daylight weather styles.** *Moon* draws tonight's moon in its real
  phase on a turning cookie, with its name, how much is lit, where tonight sits
  in the lunar month, the next full and new moon, and moonrise and moonset; a
  *Clean* layout keeps just the moon and the slider. *Daylight* walks the sun
  along an arc from sunrise to sunset, minute by minute, with the next sunset
  (or sunrise) and the day's length. Neither makes an extra request, and the
  full forecast now lists the moon's phase too (#338).

- **Five new clock faces.** *Stacked*, *Flip* and *Rings* come in both
  designs; Expressive adds *Shapes* (every digit on a shape of its own) and
  *Orbit* (the hour on a scalloped face, the minute a dot circling it). A
  Classic card set to one of those draws Stacked or Analog instead. The new
  faces size themselves to the card and drop seconds and animation on the
  Reduced and Minimal performance tiers.

- **Backgrounds drawn by Hearth.** *Hearth default* used to be a 1.5 MB photo
  fetched from GitHub, and so vanished with *Disable external calls* on. It is
  now drawn by the plugin: **Classic** is hills with a cabin and pines — a
  morning in a light theme, a moonlit night in a dark one — and **Expressive**
  gathers Material's soft shapes in the corners in your accent colour. A new
  **Harbour town** background joins it: houses stepping down to a quay, a
  lighthouse and sailing boats, by day or by lamp-lit night with the theme.
  The live weather sky gains an Expressive look too: a flat illustrated sky
  with rolling hills, bubbly clouds and pill raindrops.

  The background's *Design* sits under **Settings → Hearth → Appearance →
  Background**, and a board can override it. A new vault starts the drawn
  wallpaper at opacity 0.8 with no blur; switching between it and a photo
  moves those between 0.8/0 and 0.35/2. Values you've already saved are kept.

- **A card for the Vault Pet plugin.** Shows
  [Vault Pet](https://github.com/elliott-json-park/obsidian-vault-pet)'s pet
  card or its whole pet house on the board, drawn by the plugin itself — so
  the pet animates and can be petted, and Hearth keeps no copy of its data.
  Find it in the "Add card" picker's Fun section. Hearth's own *Pet* card is
  unchanged.

### Changed

- **A shorter, visual setup wizard.** First-run setup is three steps instead of
  six: what the vault is for (with the plugins Hearth found), the look — design
  (Expressive recommended), background and, for Classic, card style, each
  shown as a small painting — and a scale preview of the board about to be
  built. The boards it builds have no empty
  cards and no holes: working cards in a main column, small ones (a switchable
  clock, calendar, weather, statistics) in a side column, and cards that need a
  feed or a place ask for it in the wizard instead of arriving unconfigured.

- **Smaller touches.**
  - A dashboard can be deleted from its own settings, not only from a
    right-click.
  - The Ko-fi button is a filled pill in Ko-fi's red, with a cup that wobbles
    under the pointer (unless you've asked for less motion).
  - The folder browser fills its columns row by row, left to right.

### Fixed

- **Settings keep your place.** Flipping a toggle or editing a list halfway
  down Hearth's settings, a card's or board's settings, or the setup wizard no
  longer throws the pane back to the top. Long category names in the gallery
  and the add-card picker wrap instead of being cut off.

- **A board set to *Hearth default* keeps it.** Choosing it in a board's own
  background settings painted nothing and was forgotten on restart.


## [3.1.1]

### Added

- **A Folder card.** Lists what sits one level inside a folder — subfolders
  and files, as rows or tiles — in the same order as the file explorer,
  including a custom order from a plugin such as
  [Flexplorer](https://github.com/kh4f/flexplorer); name, modified and created
  orders are offered too. Clicking a file opens it; a subfolder opens a folder
  browser you can walk the whole tree in (Ctrl/Cmd-click keeps it open while
  opening notes), or, with *Opening a subfolder* set to *In the card*, walks
  the card itself into it (#329).

- **The Periodic note card reads from Journals.** A new *Source* setting
  points the card at the
  [Journals](https://github.com/srg-kostyrko/obsidian-journal) plugin instead
  of Periodic Notes. You pick a journal by name, so several journals of the
  same cadence and custom cadences all work, and notes are resolved and created
  through Journals' own API with its folders and templates. Existing cards keep
  reading from Periodic Notes (#318).

- **Tasks gain tags, descriptions and more filters.**
  - **Tags** — a *Tags* field in the quick view, *Edit details* and the Kanban
    *+ Add card* form, written as `#tag` in the task line (or a linked note's
    frontmatter) and shown as a chip rather than in the title.
  - **Filter by tag** — *Filter tasks* gains a Tags row built from the card's
    own tasks.
  - **Descriptions** — lines indented under a `- [ ]` checkbox show as muted
    sub-bullets under the task and can be edited, leaving sub-tasks alone.
  - **Filter on Kanban** — the board offers the list layout's *Filter* button;
    columns stay put and thin out.

- **Choose the width at which the board goes narrow.** *Narrow below*, under
  **Settings → Hearth → Mobile → Layout** and per board in *Dashboard settings
  → Layout*, sets the width at which the board becomes a single stacked
  column. It was fixed at 600 pixels; it now defaults to 700, because many
  phones report a viewport just over 600 and got the desktop layout. A pane
  between 600 and 700 pixels now stacks — set 600 to keep the old behaviour
  (#316, #326).

- **Hearth speaks German.** A full `de` locale joins English and Simplified
  Chinese: every string Hearth draws comes out in German when Obsidian's own
  display language is German, with no setting of its own. Anything
  untranslated falls back to English (#312).

### Changed

- **Two long-retired settings fields are gone from the code.** A mobile action
  button's pre-1.9.0 `commandId` and a clock card's `use24Hour` were already
  folded into their replacements on load; the duplicate reads are gone and the
  folds now have tests. Old `data.json` files still upgrade in place.

### Fixed

- **Every bookmark on the Bookmarks card works.** Bookmarked folders, searches
  and graphs did nothing: a folder now opens Hearth's folder browser, a search
  Obsidian's search pane, and a graph the graph view with its saved filters. A
  bookmarked heading or block opens right there instead of at the top of the
  note, and the card now updates as soon as your bookmarks change (#327).

- **The tab bar no longer flickers on macOS with a translucent window.** The
  cards' frosted glass stands down while the translucent window is on;
  your blur setting is kept and returns when you turn it off, and a note under
  *Dashboard → Card surface* says so (#272).

- **The Git card no longer asks you to enable a plugin you already have.** On
  a cold start it mistook a still-starting obsidian-git for a missing one; it
  now waits and fills itself in once the plugin is ready (#315).

- **The board no longer wobbles sideways on a phone.** The board can't be
  dragged horizontally any more, and a long one-word title wraps instead of
  pushing past the edge (#326).


## [3.1.0]

### Added

- **A dashboard gallery, and a server to host one.** Boards other people have
  published, browsable by category, search or rating, and installable in a
  click — with the way to publish your own in the same dialog you already
  export from.

  Browsing is a large modal shaped like the add-card picker: categories down
  the left, a search field across the top, and four orders to read them in —
  trending, top rated, newest, most installed. Each board shows as a thumbnail
  with its author, its score and its install count. Opening one shows what a
  thumbnail can't: **what is actually on the board**, by card kind; what it
  needs installed that you may not have; **how much of it is fetched from the
  internet**; how large the file is; and whether its author can be proved at
  all. Clicking an author opens their page — everything they have published,
  and the sum of their votes across all of it.

  **Installing has no separate path.** The package is downloaded and handed to
  the same import dialog a file picked off disk goes to, so a board from a
  stranger gets the signature check, the missing-note and missing-plugin list
  and the sanitizers, rather than a shortcut around them. As always, importing
  adds a board and touches no global setting.

  A published board can carry **a picture of itself**: a screenshot taken at
  publish with every word blanked out in the page and every embedded picture
  blurred *before* the shutter, so the layout, colours, icons and wallpaper
  survive and nothing readable does. You see the picture in the dialog before
  anything is uploaded. Desktop only, opt-in, and where there isn't one a
  wallpaper stands in, and an entry with neither says so.

  The blanking is done by *style* rather than by rewriting the page, so nothing
  is written into your notes in order to photograph them — which matters for the
  three cards whose page *is* your data, the live-preview and raw-edit note
  cards and the text card. A card that fills itself from a query is waited for
  too, so what a Bases embed renders late is blanked like everything else.

  The picture blanks out what is *inside* cards that hold something personal,
  and nothing else: the header, the toolbar, the dashboard switcher, each card's
  own title, a card with nothing of yours in it (a clock), and a calendar's own
  dates and weekdays stay as they are. Blanked text is drawn as a soft bar in
  the theme's own ink rather than as a hard block. A board taller than the
  window is scrolled through and stitched, so the picture is the whole board; a
  listing shows its top and the
  detail view shows all of it. Click it, in the dialog or in the gallery, to see
  it full size.

  Authors can also say **"recommended with Minimal"** — a toggle that fills in
  the theme they are using. Advisory: nothing installs or changes a theme.

  Each board also carries **comments** — flat, newest first, a paragraph each.
  Their author can delete their own, and a board's owner can delete any comment
  on their board, which is moderation in the hands of the person with the most
  reason to use it.

  Voting is Reddit-style — upvotes minus downvotes, and pressing the arrow you
  already chose takes it back. Worth being plain about: identities are free to
  mint, so votes are free to mint, and no amount of server-side mechanism fixes
  that. A gallery can make it tedious, and the one this repository ships does,
  but a vote count means "some number of people who have Hearth installed".

  Three ways in, all of them absent until a gallery is configured: beside **Add
  card** in arrange mode, above **Request a card** in the picker's rail, and
  beside **Next** on the setup wizard's first step — where somebody has nothing
  yet that installing a board could overwrite.

  **Nothing is fetched until you open it, and nothing is sent until you
  publish.** Hearth points at `gallery.o-uhnavy.com` out of the box; the
  address lives in Settings → Import / export → Dashboard gallery, and clearing
  it turns the gallery off entirely — no buttons, no requests — and keeps it off
  across upgrades. Point it at a different one, or at your own, in the same
  field.

  **The server is open, in
  [ondreu/hearth-gallery](https://github.com/ondreu/hearth-gallery)**, and
  [`docs/gallery-hosting.md`](docs/gallery-hosting.md) is how to run one: one
  Docker command for a local gallery, a reverse proxy and one environment
  variable for a public one, and its whole state is a single SQLite file you
  back up by copying. It has no runtime dependencies, no accounts and no
  passwords — signing in is a challenge-response against the ed25519 key that
  already signs your exports, so a breach of a gallery leaks public keys, which
  are public.

  **Publishing waits until you have said the picture is clean, and gives you
  somewhere to go when it isn't.** The photograph of the board is shown in the
  publish dialog because a promise about what a redacted screenshot contains is
  worth less than the screenshot — but nothing made you look at it. Publishing
  now asks: read the picture, then switch on *"I've looked — nothing private is
  readable in it"*. Until then the Publish button is off, and every retake asks
  again, because the answer is about one particular image. If something of
  yours **is** readable, the answer is not to publish it anyway: don't, and use
  the report link beside the switch — it opens a pre-filled GitHub bug report,
  because a picture that got past the blanking is a bug in the blanking and the
  next person it happens to will not be looking.

  **"Update" on your own gallery entry.** Opening a board you published now
  offers, beside "Remove from the gallery", a button that opens the publish
  dialog on the board this listing came from — so publishing again lands on the
  entry rather than beside it, picture and all, and you do not have to go and
  find the board first. The new picture is the one everybody sees straight
  away, rather than yesterday's for another day. It switches to that board on
  the way, since publishing photographs the board that is open. When this vault
  no longer has it — deleted, or this is another vault holding the same key —
  the button is there but greyed out and
  says why, rather than quietly making a second listing.

  Which board an entry is, Hearth writes down when it publishes one, so the
  button works against whatever gallery you are pointed at rather than only a
  freshly updated one. For an entry published before it kept that note, pressing
  Update reads the entry itself to find out, once, and remembers the answer.

  An update **opens on the listing you already wrote** — its name, description,
  category, tags and recommended theme — rather than on an empty form. Those are
  things typed once that live nowhere else in the vault, and since publishing
  replaces the entry, a blank description left blank would have quietly deleted
  the written one. Publishing a board again from the board itself fills the same
  fields in from what you said last time.

- **Share a dashboard.** Export one board — not the whole vault — as a file
  someone else can import, and get back a board that looks like the one you
  sent. **Dashboard settings → the switcher's right-click menu → Export
  dashboard**, or Settings → Import / export.

  The reason this needed building rather than tweaking is that a dashboard never
  described itself completely. Half its look lived on the board and half in the
  vault's global settings, which the board fell back to for anything it hadn't
  overridden — so a board handed to someone else arrived wearing *their* grid,
  card opacity, wallpaper and search placeholder. An export now resolves all of
  it onto the board itself: it stops inheriting and states what it is.

  **The wallpaper travels too, if you want it to.** A background picture is a
  file in your vault, and a path to it means nothing in anyone else's — so the
  export can carry the picture (and image icons, and a slideshow's explicit
  pictures) inside the file, and the import writes them into the importing
  vault. It is a toggle in the export dialog, on for a shared board and worth
  turning off for a backup of your own vault, where the pictures are already
  where they belong. Anything too large or no longer in the vault is left as a
  path and reported rather than silently dropped.

  **What you see is what travels.** The export carries the board exactly as it
  is on screen — every card's own settings, the cards you had pinned to every
  board (they arrive as ordinary cards on the imported board, so nothing gets
  pinned across the importer's vault), and the notes a Favorites card was
  showing. None of that is a question the dialog asks any more, because none of
  it is a difference you can see on a dashboard.

  Importing **adds** the board rather than replacing anything: a new board, a
  name that doesn't collide, and not one of your own settings touched. A shared
  dashboard carries an identity of its own — separate from which board it is in
  any one vault — so when the author publishes a newer version of it, importing
  that offers to *update* the board you already have instead of leaving you two
  near-identical ones in the switcher. The dialog reads the file first and
  says what is in it — who made it, what plugins it wants, which of its notes
  your vault hasn't got, whether it brought its pictures — before anything
  changes. None of those gaps stop an import; the cards come through and you
  point them at your own notes.

- **A signed, anonymous handle, instead of typing your name.** The export dialog
  used to ask for an author name. That is a bad question twice over: it is
  personal information Hearth has no reason to hold, and it is a label anybody
  can type — the first person to publish a board as somebody else's name is the
  last one anyone trusts a name from.

  So nothing is asked. Hearth makes you one **recovery key** the first time you
  export something, keeps it in your vault, and everything public follows from
  it: a handle like `quiet-lantern-4kj2m8`, and a signature on every file you
  export. It says nothing about who you are, and it is the same on everything
  you export.

  **Nobody else can publish under it.** Your handle appears in every board you
  share, so anyone can copy it — which is exactly why the file is signed. A
  reader recomputes the handle from the key in the file and then checks that the
  holder of that key really made this file. A board carrying somebody else's
  handle fails that check and is shown with no author at all, and the import
  dialog says why. This is the part that hashing alone could never do: a file is
  static, so any proof it carries, its reader has too — only a signature works.

  What it doesn't do is tell you *who* somebody is. It tells you that the same
  person made two boards, which is what a gallery needs to build reputation on
  and about as far as a file format can honestly go on its own.

  **Reinstalling doesn't lose it.** The key is the only thing worth keeping:
  paste it into a new vault (Settings → Import / export → **Published as**, or
  the same row in the export dialog) and the same handle comes back. There is no
  account and nothing is stored anywhere but your vault, which is also the catch
  — there is no reset and nobody to ask, so the export dialog keeps asking you
  to save the key until you have, and warns before letting you paste another one
  over a key you never copied. It is left out of every export file, backups
  included.

- **One switch for everything private in the file.** A dashboard export
  deliberately carries the paths it points at — that is what makes it work as
  your own backup — which is exactly wrong for a board you are about to publish.
  **Leave out my private information** removes the note and folder paths,
  calendar feed links, an internal Jira host, your location, and anything you
  typed on a text card. The board still looks identical; the cards just arrive
  pointing at nothing, which whoever downloads it has to fill in anyway.

  And it can be checked rather than trusted. **See and tune exactly what
  travels** opens a section that lists the actual values — read from this board,
  not described in the abstract — for each group it removes, and lets each group
  be turned on or off separately (queries and command ids are off by default,
  since removing those stops the board doing anything). Left as it is, the same
  section lists everything the file will mention. It is built only when you open
  it, so an export you never expand costs nothing.

- **Plugin view dashboards.** A dashboard no longer has to be a grid of cards.
  Set one to **Plugin view** (Dashboard settings → General → **Dashboard type**)
  and the whole board becomes a single plugin's view — your RSS reader, a Kanban
  board, a Canvas, the outline — at full size, running for real rather than
  previewed in a card.

  The point is what stays around it: the **dashboard switcher, the header and
  the background are still there**, so the reader you check twenty times a day is
  one click from your task board instead of a tab you have to find your way back
  from. Switching is instant, because a plugin board **stays loaded while another
  board is showing** rather than reloading from cold each visit. Up to three
  boards are kept warm at once, least-recently-used first out; a heavy plugin you
  would rather not leave running can opt out per board.

  Pick the view on the board's new **Plugin view** tab. Unlike the Plugin view
  *card*, the list includes Obsidian's own document surfaces — Markdown, PDF,
  image, audio, video — because a full board has room for them and a file picker
  right beside the type picker, so a specific note, drawing or PDF can *be* a
  dashboard. Also there: hiding the hosted view's own breadcrumb header, the
  keep-loaded toggle, and an experimental **Let the view take focus**, which
  makes the plugin's own commands and hotkeys target the board (at the cost of
  Obsidian sometimes opening a clicked note into it).

  **The board spends no space on itself.** The hosted view runs edge to edge —
  no page gutter, no card frame, no toolbar row — and the only chrome left is
  the switcher strip along the top, with the board's settings gear on the
  right-hand end of it. The title and search start hidden for the same reason,
  and each is still an ordinary per-board override you can switch back on. Its
  cards are kept, not deleted: turn the board back into a **Cards** board and
  they return exactly as they were.

- **The heatmap can count whatever you actually track.** The activity heatmap
  only ever knew two things: notes edited, notes created. That is a fine picture
  of a vault and a poor picture of a habit — the run you logged on Sunday and
  wrote up on Wednesday landed on Wednesday. The card's settings gained an
  **Advanced** switch (off by default, and off changes nothing) that turns the
  grid into a metric you define (#268).

  **Where a day comes from.** *Day comes from* can now be **a frontmatter
  date** instead of the file's own: name the property — `date`, `due`,
  `published` — and each note lands on the day it says, not the day you touched
  it. It reads a date, a date and time, or a `[[daily note]]` link, and a list
  property counts once per entry, so `done: [2026-08-30, 2026-08-31]` marks both
  squares. Notes without the property simply don't appear.

  **What a square counts.** *Each note adds* is normally 1 — the note count.
  Point it at a number in frontmatter instead and the day is a **sum**: minutes
  read, pages written, kilometres run. A note whose value isn't a number is
  skipped rather than quietly counted as one, so the two metrics never mix. The
  **Unit** field names what you are counting, so a day reads "5 workouts"
  instead of "5 notes edited".

  **Which notes count.** Under **Which notes count** you can stack rules — a
  property, a tag, a folder or a path, tested with *is*, *is not*, *contains*,
  *does not contain*, *is more than*, *is less than*, *is set* or *is not set* —
  and choose whether a note has to match **all** of them or **any** of them.
  Numbers compare as numbers and dates as dates, tags match with or without
  their `#` and cover their nested tags, and a rule you are still typing counts
  as no rule rather than blanking the card. So: every note tagged `#health`
  whose `type` is `run`, summed by `minutes`, on the day in `date` — one grid,
  one year of running.

- **The Ko-fi tip button, where you actually meet it.** The tip button used to
  live only in Settings → About, which is the one place nobody visits after the
  first day. It now also sits at the foot of the **"What's new" dialog**, to the
  left of *Got it*, and at the bottom of the **add-card picker's** rail, right
  under *Request a card*.

  Same button in all three, on purpose: white, with the Ko-fi red cup, opening
  <https://ko-fi.com/ondru>. Entirely optional, as it has always been — nothing
  in Hearth is behind it.

- **The board keeps your place.** Hearth rebuilds the whole board whenever you
  come back to its tab, and that rebuild used to drop you at the top: follow a
  link out of a card, switch back, and a board you had scrolled halfway down
  started again from the beginning (#276). Each tab now remembers where it was
  scrolled to and puts itself back there.

  Per tab and per dashboard: two Hearth tabs keep their own places, and each
  board comes back where you left it rather than at the depth of the board you
  were on before. The memory rides along with the tab, so it survives a reload
  of Obsidian — and a Hearth tab you *replace* by opening a note in it takes its
  place with it, so opening Hearth fresh afterwards still starts at the top.

- **Sync arrives without a restart.** Edit a dashboard on the desktop, walk over
  to the laptop, and the board you get is the one that machine read when
  Obsidian started — the synced version only appeared after quitting and
  reopening the app. Hearth now watches its own settings file and adopts another
  device's changes as they land, boards, cards and card contents alike.

  It also closes the worse half of that problem. The window holding the stale
  copy used to write it straight back on its next save, so the edit you made on
  the other machine could be *undone* by moving a card here. That copy is now
  brought up to date instead, in place, so what gets saved is the synced state.

  Deliberately careful about it: a file caught half-written by a sync client is
  ignored rather than acted on, settings identical to the ones already loaded
  re-render nothing, and a board you are in the middle of arranging is left
  alone until you are done. Off is available — Settings → Behaviour → **Pick up
  synced changes** — but on is the honest default.

- **A board can carry its own search row, chrome and sky.** Nine settings that
  decide how a board looks were vault-wide only: the search placeholder, the
  button beside the search field (whether it's there, what it does, what it
  says), which filter chips show, whether the board stacks into one column when
  narrow, whether the arrange button and the dashboard switcher stay visible or
  fade in on hover, and whether the painted weather sky drifts. Each is now a
  per-board override in Dashboard settings, following the vault until you say
  otherwise — which is both a feature in its own right and what lets an exported
  board describe its whole appearance.

  The sky override can ask for motion but never insist on it: the performance
  tier and your own reduced-motion setting still have the last word, so an
  imported board can't start animating on a device that has opted out.

- **The "Search online" button can search somewhere other than DuckDuckGo.**
  The button used to be wired to DuckDuckGo and nothing else. It still opens
  DuckDuckGo out of the box, but it now carries an arrow beside it: click that
  and pick DuckDuckGo, DuckDuckGo with its AI features off
  (`noai.duckduckgo.com`), Brave, Kagi, Google, Mojeek, Ecosia or Qwant for that
  one search, without
  changing anything.

  Which engine the button itself opens is **Settings → Appearance → Online
  search engine**, and it travels in a full settings backup like every other
  setting. Every engine on the list is a plain query URL — no key, no account,
  nothing fetched in the background: the button opens a link in your browser
  exactly as it always did.

- **"Open dashboard 1…9" — go to a particular board in one shortcut.** Hearth
  could switch the active dashboard, and it could open Hearth, but going to a
  named board from a note took both, which meant a macro plugin to chain them.
  There is now a second command per position that does the two together, so a
  hotkey or a note-toolbar button can land you on the board you want from
  anywhere in the vault. "Switch to dashboard N" is unchanged and keeps its
  hotkeys, for when Hearth is already in front of you.

### Changed

- **"Export dashboard" is now "Share dashboard",** with a switch at the top for
  where it is going: a file, or the gallery. The two asked almost the same
  questions and differed only in their defaults, so they are one dialog rather
  than two that drift apart. It also gained the board's own thumbnail at the
  top — the same one a gallery listing draws — and a **category**, which is the
  one thing about a published dashboard that cannot be worked out from it.

  Publishing names what it takes out — every note, folder and attachment path;
  private calendar feeds, private hosts and your location; anything you typed on
  a text card and a calculator's last sum; every credential a card can hold —
  and what it keeps, which is the board itself. The details section lists the
  actual values, so it can be checked rather than believed. The wallpaper is a
  plain switch at the top, on by default, on both sides.

### Fixed

- **A card hidden from the narrow board can be brought back from a phone.**
  Hiding a card for the stacked layout took it off the board — including off the
  board its own settings are reached from — so the switch could only be turned
  back off from a desktop or by forcing the wide layout. Arranging a stacked
  board now shows the hidden cards too, greyed out and dashed, each with an eye
  button in its header that puts it back. They are never built while they sit
  there (hiding a card is usually because it is expensive or needs width), they
  keep their place in the stack so unhiding returns a card where it was left,
  and outside arrange mode nothing changes: hidden stays hidden, and the
  free-form board on a desktop is untouched.

- **"Disable external calls" now also covers a background image and a title icon
  given as a web address.** The switch promises to block every outbound request
  Hearth makes, and every card kept that promise — but a wallpaper whose kind is
  "Image URL", the bundled default wallpaper (which is served from GitHub rather
  than from the plugin folder), and a title icon pointed at an `https://` address
  were all set straight onto the page and fetched regardless. That was a footnote
  while those strings were ones you typed yourself; with boards now shared and
  installed from a gallery they are strings a stranger chose, and a board can be
  authored so that merely opening it reports your IP to a host of the author's
  choosing. All three are now blocked while the switch is on, and a blocked
  wallpaper falls back to no picture — a bannered board loses the strip rather
  than reserving an empty one — while a blocked icon falls back to the Hearth
  crystal. Nothing is rewritten: turn the switch off and the wallpaper and the
  icon come back. **If you have deliberately set a URL wallpaper or icon and have
  the switch on, that picture will disappear on upgrade** — either point it at a
  vault attachment, or turn the switch off.

- **A full settings backup no longer forgets eleven settings.** Export every
  Hearth setting, restore it into a fresh vault, and eleven of them came back at
  their defaults instead of yours: the theme-colour target, the mobile
  performance tier, both chrome-visibility choices, focus-search-on-open, live
  refresh, pick-up-synced-changes, stack-when-narrow, custom file icons, the
  Iconize property name, and the Operon writes switch. They were never written
  to the file, so nothing could restore them. All eleven now travel, and a test
  checks the export against the settings list so the next one added can't slip
  through the same gap.

- **A restored backup keeps its painted sky.** A vault whose background was the
  weather sky restored with no background at all: the importer's list of
  background kinds had never been updated with `weather`, so the setting failed
  its check and was dropped. The per-board background override was unaffected.

- **Exports and backups no longer drop eight kinds of card setting.** A card's
  configuration is what the card *is*, and the importer's allowlist had never
  been told about eight blocks of it — so a Calendar card came back with no
  feeds, a weather card pointing nowhere, and the Periodic, Templater, search
  bar, Stats, pet and recent-file-type settings back at their defaults. It
  looked like nothing was wrong, because an unconfigured card of the right kind
  still renders. All of them now travel, in single-dashboard exports and in full
  backups alike, and a test walks every kind's config block so the next one
  added cannot slip through the same gap.

- **Duplicating a dashboard copies all of it.** The duplicate action carried a
  hand-written list of fields, which had fallen behind every override added
  after it was written — a copy came out subtly unlike the board it came from.
  It now clones the board and takes back only the two things a copy must not
  share: a workspace link and the mobile-default flag.

- **Frosted glass no longer smears across the gaps between cards.** With the
  card blur turned on, two cards sitting apart on a board could show a single
  frosted sheet stretched between them — the wallpaper in the empty space
  blurred as if a pane of glass were floating there, with the cards resting on
  it. On a board whose cards touch it looked right; the further apart they were,
  the more obviously wrong it got.

  The blur behind cards is drawn on a shared layer rather than on each card,
  because one continuous surface is what lets a run of touching cards read as a
  single frosted tile instead of showing a bright seam where they meet. But that
  layer was sized to hold *every* blurred card on the board at once, so it had to
  span the gaps between them, and only a mask cut to the card silhouettes kept
  the blur out of those gaps. Where that mask wasn't honoured, the whole
  rectangle came through frosted.

  Each run of touching cards now gets its own layer, sized to just those cards.
  A card standing on its own gets a layer no bigger than itself, so there is
  nothing stretched over a gap to go wrong in the first place — and touching
  cards still share one surface, so they stay seamless. Boards with cards spread
  out also do a little less compositing work than before, since each blur pass
  now covers a card instead of the whole board.

- **No more blurred frame around a frosted card.** A card with the blur on could
  wear a band of blurred wallpaper around its outside, a couple of dozen pixels
  wide, as though the glass were larger than the card sitting on it. The blur
  layer was deliberately drawn bigger than its cards — the theory being that a
  blurred layer goes soft at its own edges, so it should reach past the card and
  let the mask trim the overhang back. Wherever that mask wasn't honoured, the
  overhang was simply visible.

  The layer is now exactly the size of its cards and rounds its corners the way
  they do, so there is no overhang for a mask to have to hide. Measured side by
  side at 2×, the old padding bought nothing you could see against a photographic
  wallpaper anyway — it only ever showed up against hard, contrived patterns.

- **A board with a single card gets its frosted glass.** The blur behind cards
  is rebuilt by the same pass that decides which cards touch, and that pass bailed
  out early when there was nothing that *could* touch — so a board holding exactly
  one card came out with no frosted glass at all, however high its blur was set.

- **Chaining "switch dashboard" and "open Hearth" showed the old board.** Two
  commands run back to back — by a Commander macro, a note-toolbar button,
  anything that chains them — switched the dashboard in settings and then
  revealed the previous one, while each command on its own behaved. A board that
  is open but off screen is deliberately not re-rendered when settings change,
  on the understanding that whatever next puts it on screen will render it.
  Revealing a tab turned out not to be one of those things: Obsidian reports a
  leaf becoming active, and a leaf that was already the active one in a hidden
  tab group never becomes active again. A skipped render is now remembered
  against the board rather than assumed away, and every route back on screen
  pays it.

## [3.0.0]

### Added

- **Hearth works on a phone.** Mobile used to have exactly two settings: the
  full desktop board, laid out for a screen ten times wider, or **Mobile mode**
  — the search field and nothing else. That was not a gap in the features, it
  was a gap in the *layout*. Cards are placed as fractions of the board's width,
  so a quarter-width card on a 390px phone is 90px across, and their heights are
  fixed pixels that never compress. There was no width at which the board became
  readable, so the only honest answer was to hide it.

  A board narrower than **600px** now reflows into **a single full-width
  column**, top to bottom, in the order the desktop board reads in. Your layout
  is untouched — the stacked view is worked out fresh on every render and never
  written back — so the same board is a launcher in your pocket and a wall of
  cards on your monitor, and neither reshapes the other. It can be turned off
  under **Settings → Hearth → Mobile** (#205).

  The threshold is the **measured width of the board**, not the platform. A
  narrow desktop pane had exactly the same problem and gets exactly the same
  fix; an iPad in landscape has neither and keeps the real board. It also means
  the phone layout can be seen without a phone, by dragging a pane narrow.

  **Tuning a card for the column.** Every card's settings (Layout tab) gained an
  **On a narrow board** section, for where stacking the desktop layout guesses
  wrong. Each is an override that defaults to absent — a board you never touch
  carries nothing new — and all four travel with an exported layout.

  - **Hide** — leave the card out of the column entirely. For a wide table or a
    board view, hiding beats squeezing.
  - **Start collapsed** — show only the card's title row, and build the card
    when it is tapped open. A collapsed card that nobody opens costs one row and
    runs *nothing*: no query, no iframe, no timer.
  - **Height** — a height for the stacked column. Left empty, the card keeps its
    own, capped so one tall card can't take the whole screen.
  - **Position** — where the card comes in the stack. Left empty, it follows the
    board's reading order.

  **Building it from your desk.** Arrange mode has a new **Preview at phone
  width** button, which clamps the board to a phone's width and draws a phone
  around it. It is not a simulation — the narrow layout is chosen by width, so
  the preview *is* the phone layout, at the width that triggers it; the shell is
  there because "is this card a comfortable third of a screen or most of one" is
  a question about the device, and you answer it by seeing the board sit in one.
  Arranging a stacked board then works the two things a stacked card owns: drag
  its bottom edge to set its height, and use the **move up** / **move down**
  buttons in its header to reorder. Card contents are shielded while arranging,
  as they are on the free-form board, but the column still scrolls under your
  finger.

  **Room to work in.** A narrow board goes edge to edge — the 24px gutter down
  each side is 12% of a phone's width spent on nothing — while keeping the
  safe-area insets, which are the rounded corner and the camera cut-out rather
  than decoration. **Filter chips** and **search results** grow to 44px tap
  targets. The search row uses the whole screen: with a button beside it the bar
  took about half a phone's width, and the chips and results list, which hang
  off the bar's column, inherited that half and left the rest empty — they now
  span the full width on their own line, and the button keeps its icon and drops
  its label to a tooltip.

  **Its own category, and its own performance tier.** The mobile settings moved
  out of **Behaviour** into a **Mobile** category of their own: Hearth runs on a
  phone as a first-class board now rather than as a reduced mode of the desktop
  one, and the settings pane is where that is either stated or quietly
  contradicted. It carries a performance tier of its own, defaulting to
  **Balanced** — the animated sky is the most expensive thing Hearth draws, and
  on a phone it is drawn on the smallest screen there is and paid for out of a
  battery. Your desktop tier is stored separately and is not touched; set the
  mobile one to **Match desktop** for the previous behaviour.

- **A card for your weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly note.** The new
  **Periodic note** card shows whichever periodic note covers *right now* —
  this week's by default, or the month, quarter or year, picked in the card's
  settings — and rolls over to the next one on its own when the period ends.
  Like the Daily note card it can be read-only, edited in place (raw or Live
  Preview), and carry a button that opens the note in the editor. Where the
  note lives, what it is called and what a new one contains stays entirely
  [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes)'
  business: the card asks the plugin where the note is, and a note that doesn't
  exist yet is created by Periodic Notes from your own template — so it is the
  same note its own command would open. Both generations of the plugin are
  supported, the released 0.x and the 1.0 beta. The Daily note card is
  untouched (#116).

- **The board can be as wide as your monitor.** **Content width** used to stop
  at 1600px, which on a large display left the board marooned in the middle of
  an empty pane. The slider now runs to **3840px** — the full width of a 4K
  panel — and above it sits **Full width**, which drops the ceiling altogether
  and lets the content follow the pane at whatever size it is. The column was
  always fluid *downwards*; this is the same behaviour going up. Both settings
  are overridable per dashboard under a board's own settings, so one board can
  fill an ultrawide while the rest stay comfortable to read, and both travel
  with an exported layout. Nothing changes for a board you leave alone: the
  ceiling stays where it was (#251).

- **Launchpad buttons can fill their card.** A launchpad used to size its
  buttons in pixels, so a card too small for them all simply scrolled — the
  buttons past the edge weren't there until you scrolled to them. The Links /
  launchpad, Commands and "New note from template" cards now have a **Button
  sizing** setting, under **Buttons** in the card's own **Layout** settings, with
  a new **Fill the card** style: the card is divided into as many columns as
  **Buttons across** says (six by default) and as many rows as the buttons come
  to, and the rows share the card's height between them. So a button is a
  fraction of the card in both directions — it grows and shrinks with the card
  the way a card grows with the dashboard, every button stays visible whatever
  size the card is, and the card needs no scrollbar. Buttons stop shrinking at
  **Minimum button size** — in either direction — rather than dwindling to
  something you can't read or hit; a card too small for them all at that size
  scrolls, as the old style always did. It sits at 28px, low enough that buttons
  usually fit rather than a scrollbar appearing, and each card can raise it (to
  96px) to keep its buttons comfortable and take the scrollbar instead.
  Each button's icon and label scale to the button — up to the size Obsidian uses
  for small UI text, so a big button carries more air rather than a headline —
  and a button too small to carry its label shows just its icon. Buttons stay
  tied to the grid, sized in whole cells rather than freely in pixels, so a
  launchpad still reads as a launchpad rather than a second free-form board — a
  button can still be dragged to a spot, and dragged two or three cells wide (or
  tall) by its bottom-right corner in arrange mode.

  Every launchpad you already have keeps the **Fixed size (legacy)** style, down
  to the pixel: buttons that stay the size they are, so a wider card fits more of
  them rather than bigger ones, and a card too small for them scrolls as before.
  Cards added from now on start on the filled style, and either card can be
  switched at any time. The two styles keep their sizes and their arrangements
  separately, so switching over to look and switching back leaves a card exactly
  as it was.

- **A weather card opens the whole forecast when you click it.** The card is a
  glance, and every style is a choice about how much of the reading reaches the
  surface — which left the rest of the response, already fetched and sitting in
  memory, with nowhere to be read. **Clicking a weather card** now opens the
  forecast in full: the current conditions with **every** reading the API
  returned — feels like, humidity, wind and gusts, chance of rain and the rain
  so far, cloud cover, pressure, UV, sunrise and sunset — then **the whole week**
  as a list of days you can pick from, and the picked day **hour by hour**, with
  its condition, temperature, feels like, rain, wind, humidity and UV. Today
  starts at the hour you are in.

  It ignores the card's **What to display** toggles on purpose: those decide what
  the *card* is for, not what you are allowed to look up. Units and the 12/24-hour
  clock stay the card's, because that is how you read a forecast. The dialog also
  says when the reading was fetched and has a **Refresh** button that updates the
  card behind it — left out when external calls are disabled, since there would
  be nothing to fetch. A card still loading, or one that never loaded, isn't
  clickable: there is nothing to open yet.

### Fixed

- **The dashboard switcher wraps instead of running off the side of the board.**
  A row of boards is unbounded — you can keep adding them — but the switcher was
  a non-wrapping flex row, and a flex row that outgrows its container does not
  get clipped by it, it grows straight through the side. Past about a dozen
  boards (far fewer on a phone) the buttons ran off the edge, which made the
  whole board horizontally scrollable and dragged the cards sideways with it.
  The button row now wraps onto a second line: the row gets taller, the board
  stays the width of the pane.

- **Fit-to-page no longer piles cards on top of each other on a short screen.**
  A fitted board scales every card's top and bottom by one shared factor, which
  is what guarantees that cards which didn't overlap still don't. The final
  height was then floored at 56px with a `Math.max` — and since that can only
  make a card *taller* than the scale placed it, any card squeezed below 56px
  grew past its neighbour's top edge. Squeeze hard enough that ordinary cards
  fall under the floor and every one of them clamps to the same height and the
  board collapses into a heap. That is the ordinary case on a phone-shaped
  viewport, not an extreme one. The floor is now scaled along with everything
  else, which makes it inert for any card that was at least 56px to begin with
  and puts it back to being what it was for: a guard against a nonsense stored
  height, not a second placement rule fighting the first.

- **A card that redraws itself is properly reset first.** Cards redraw
  constantly — when a file they show is edited, when the vault changes at all,
  when an embed card's view switcher is clicked — and each redraw emptied the
  card's body without undoing two things the previous one had left outside it.
  The floating **open button** (Daily note, Embed, Slideshow) lives on the card
  rather than in its body, so it survived, and a fresh one was stacked on top
  every time; being 70% opaque and pixel-aligned, the pile read as a single
  button quietly darkening as you worked. And the marks a render leaves on the
  body — which say whether it drew a picture, a Live Preview editor or plain
  text, and control the card's padding — stayed behind too, so an embed card
  switched from its picture view to a note kept the picture's edge-to-edge
  padding and drew the note flush against the card's sides. A redraw now starts
  from exactly the state the first one did.

- **No more pale slab behind the tabs in a card's or a board's settings.** The
  tab strip was pinned to the top of the dialog so the tabs stay reachable while
  a long tab scrolls past, and a pinned strip has to paint over whatever passes
  underneath it. It painted with the *note* background — a colour plenty of
  themes reserve for notes alone — so on those themes the tabs sat on a
  rectangle in the wrong shade. Hearth now measures the colour the dialog is
  actually painted with as it opens, however the theme sets it, and pins the
  strip only when there is a colour it can match exactly. A dialog wearing no
  such colour — a glass or translucent theme, where painting even the dialog's
  own colour a second time would double the tint — keeps a strip that simply
  scrolls with the rest of the dialog. The tabs go by as you scroll on those
  themes; nothing is ever painted in the wrong shade on any of them.

- **Half buttons are back on a launchpad that fills its card.** Sizing a
  launchpad's buttons in pixels (2.2.0's "Fixed size (legacy)") laid them on a
  *fine* grid — a 44px cell, half a default button — so a half-width or
  half-height button was a size you could simply drag to, and plenty of boards
  used one: a wall of full buttons with a couple of small ones tucked beside
  them. **Fill the card** put its buttons on a grid of whole cells only, and a
  gesture that could no longer land between two of them rounded a half button up
  to a whole one. Filling the card cost you a size you had.

  The filled grid is now drawn at *half*-cell resolution, so a button can be
  half a cell wide, half a cell tall, or both, and the resize handle snaps to
  each half step — the fine grid's granularity, on a grid that still scales with
  the card. A button already on the grid is untouched: a whole cell is two of
  the new tracks plus the gap they give up between them, so it comes out at
  exactly the pixel it did before, and **Minimum button size** still floors a
  whole button at what it says (a half one at half of that). Sizes and positions
  are stored in cells as they always were, now in steps of a half, so a board
  saved by 2.2.0 reads back unchanged — and a card switched over from the fixed
  style now keeps its buttons' proportions to the half rather than rounding them
  (#261).

### Changed

- **One "Title icon" setting, and it takes a picture.** The mark beside a
  board's heading was split across two fields — **Logo**, holding an emoji or a
  couple of characters, and **Title icon**, holding a Lucide id that silently
  won whenever both were set — in the vault-wide settings and again in every
  board's own. They are now a single **Title icon**, in both places, that reads
  whatever you give it:

  - a **Lucide icon** id (`flame`), browsable from the 🔍 button as before;
  - an **emoji or short text**, shown verbatim;
  - the **vault path of an image** (`Assets/logo.png`), pickable from a new 📷
    button — so a board can wear your own mark rather than a stock icon;
  - the **URL of an image on the web**;
  - or nothing at all, for the Hearth crystal.

  A picture is sized off the same **Title icon size** slider (renamed from
  "Logo size") that a Lucide icon uses, so it lines up with the title at any
  scale, and a vault image that has been moved or deleted falls back to the
  crystal rather than leaving a gap. The setup wizard asks once instead of
  twice, and its field takes all of the above too.

  **On upgrade, every board keeps the mark it was already showing.** The old
  pair is folded into the new field by what it *drew*, not by which field held
  it — so a board whose own logo text was being hidden by a vault-wide Lucide
  icon keeps the icon, and one that had opted out of that icon keeps its text.
  A board whose merged value matches the vault-wide one drops its override
  entirely, so a later change to the global icon still reaches it. The fold is
  one-way: downgrading below 3.0.0 afterwards shows the Hearth crystal again
  until the old fields are set anew. A settings export taken before 3.0.0
  imports through the same fold (#252).

## [2.2.0]

### Added

- **A slideshow can change once a day, and it stays where you left it.** The
  slideshow card's **Change picture** setting now offers three ways to move on:
  **on a timer** (what it always did), **once a day**, or **only by hand**. A
  daily card works its picture out from today's date rather than from a clock,
  so redrawing the board, switching dashboards, editing the card or restarting
  Obsidian all land on the same picture — it changes at midnight and not before.
  **Days per picture** stretches that to any number of days up to a year, for a
  picture of the week or of the month, and a board left open overnight turns its
  picture over on its own. A "random" daily card deals its order once and keeps
  it, so random still means a different picture each day rather than a different
  one every time the board blinks.

  Both the daily and the by-hand cards **remember where they were left** and
  come back to it after a restart — stepping a daily card forward simply
  re-anchors it, so tomorrow continues from the picture you chose. The position
  is kept per vault on this machine, not in the layout, so it never travels
  through sync. Cards saved before this that had their interval set to 0 — the
  old way of saying "don't rotate" — now read as by-hand cards, and so gain the
  remembered position too (#249).

- **The "New note" button is yours to configure.** Settings → Appearance →
  **The "New note" button** now decides what that button makes: give it a
  **Templater template** and it creates the note from that instead of a blank
  one, send it to a **folder** of your choosing (created if it isn't there yet),
  and name the note with a **filename pattern** — `{{date}}`, `{{date:FMT}}`,
  `{{time}}`, `{{time:FMT}}` and `{{prompt}}`, the same tokens the Templater
  card uses, with `{{prompt}}` asking you for the name on each click. The
  button's **text** is configurable too, so it can read "Capture" or "New
  meeting note". Templater does the templating, exactly as it does from its own
  command: your user scripts, `tp.system.prompt()` dialogs and cursor placement
  all behave unchanged, and the note opens the way Hearth opens notes rather
  than replacing your board. The settings drive the header button, a search-bar
  card's button and Hearth's "Create new note" command alike; leave them alone
  and the button does what it always did. Folder and filename apply to a blank
  note too, so it is configurable without Templater installed (#227).

- **Move an Operon task by dragging it, and add one from the card.** The Operon
  board card now supports **drag and drop between status columns** — with the
  same move on each row's **right-click menu**, so it is reachable without a
  pointer — and the
  board and list cards offer a **+** that creates a task. Both are off until you
  switch on **Allow changes** under Settings → Hearth → Integrations → Operon:
  Operon's developer grant is all-or-nothing, so asking for write access by
  default would make every read-only vault approve it, and turning it on widens
  the request and needs a fresh approval in Operon's own Developer API
  Integrations.

  Operon stays in charge of both. Hearth previews a change, Operon rates it and
  applies it, and any plan it marks as needing consent — or as more than routine
  — is confirmed with you before it runs. A move carries the status the board
  was drawn from, so a drag on a board that has gone stale is refused instead of
  silently reverting a change made elsewhere. Where a new task lives, and
  whether it is an inline checkbox or its own note, is read from Operon's own
  settings rather than decided by the card — with a **New tasks** choice on the
  card for the times that decision doesn't work: Operon offers two configured
  targets (an inline one — the daily note, a specific file or the active file —
  and a task note in its own folder), and a card can ask for either when one of
  them can't be resolved. A refused create now names the target Operon was
  configured to use, so *"Configured Daily Note target is unavailable or
  invalid"* says which setting it means. And if Operon can't confirm whether
  a change landed, Hearth resolves that one plan with Operon and then says the
  outcome is uncertain — it never re-applies, which is how a task ends up moved
  twice.

- **Operon tasks, boards, agendas and the running timer on the dashboard.** Four
  new cards read from the [Operon](https://github.com/hasanyilmaz/operon) task
  plugin: a task **list**, a **board** whose columns are Operon's own pipeline
  statuses in its order and colours, an **agenda** grouping the next few days of
  due work, and a **timer** showing the active tracker, ticking live. Filter by
  pipeline, status, priority, completion state, note or text — the pickers offer
  what Operon actually has, so there are no ids to type — or delegate the
  question entirely by picking one of Operon's own scopes (*Happening today*,
  *Overdue*, *Recently touched*). Clicking a task opens its note, landing on the
  exact line for an inline task. The **Mini calendar** card can mark days with an
  Operon task due and list them in the agenda alongside external-calendar events.

  Unlike the TaskNotes integration, this reads nothing off disk: Operon ships an
  in-process developer API, and Hearth uses it, so recurrence, statuses,
  priorities and what counts as done all stay Operon's to define and keep working
  as Operon changes. The integration is **read-only** — no card here modifies a
  task.

  Operon's developer API is **desktop-only, needs Obsidian 1.12.2 or newer**, and
  requires **your approval**: Hearth's first request appears under Settings →
  Operon → Core → General → Developer API Integrations, and the cards say exactly
  what they're waiting for until you approve it. Settings → Hearth →
  Integrations shows the connection status, the read access Hearth asks for, and
  a switch to turn the whole thing off.

- **Filter TaskNotes tasks by Context and Project.** The Tasks card's filter
  modal now offers Contexts and Projects as chip rows for TaskNotes sources,
  alongside the status and priority chips, so a card can show just the work for
  one project or one context without a query (#231).

- **The setup wizard offers Operon.** "Found in your vault" now includes Operon
  and, when you accept it, the built board arrives with an **Operon tasks** card
  on it. The offer appears only where the card could actually work — Operon's
  Developer API is desktop-only and needs Obsidian 1.12.2, so the wizard uses
  the same two checks the Add card picker does rather than merely noticing the
  plugin is installed. It is off by default, and says up front that Operon will
  ask you to approve Hearth the first time the card loads.

- **Hearth speaks Simplified Chinese.** A full `zh` locale joins English, so
  every string Hearth draws — commands, notices, the setup wizard, all of the
  plugin and card settings, card bodies and the add-card picker — comes out in
  简体中文 when Obsidian's own display language is Chinese. It is picked up from
  Obsidian's language at load and needs no setting of its own; regional codes
  fall back to `zh`, and anything untranslated still falls back to English. The
  README has a Chinese translation too ([README.zh-CN.md](README.zh-CN.md)).

### Fixed

- **Hovering the search bar no longer lights a grey slab inside it.** Obsidian
  paints every text input on hover, and that rule outranked the one that makes
  Hearth's search field transparent, so a second rounded rectangle — carrying
  the field's own corner radius, not the bar's — appeared inset inside the bar.
  The bar keeps drawing its own hover and focus affordance; only the stray
  rectangle is gone.
- **The setup wizard no longer changes your vault-wide settings.** Running setup
  — or re-running it later from **Settings → Hearth → About → Build a
  dashboard** — used to write its answers straight into the global settings: the
  title, logo and accent, the card surface preset, compact spacing, the
  background, and the TaskNotes field mapping. On a fresh install that was
  invisible; on a re-run it silently restyled *every* board you already had and
  repointed every Tasks card in the vault. Every answer now lands on the
  dashboard the wizard builds — as a per-board override, or on the card itself
  for the TaskNotes field names and completed statuses — so a setup run cannot
  touch another board or a vault-wide preference. Two new per-board overrides
  came out of it, both also available from a board's own settings: **Compact
  spacing** and **Accent colour on the title**. And the wizard no longer asks
  about the things that can only be vault-wide — opening Hearth on startup,
  using it for new tabs, focusing search on open, where notes open, Omnisearch
  as the search engine, and Iconic/Iconize file icons — since it cannot set them
  without changing Hearth everywhere; each is one toggle in **Settings →
  Hearth**.
- **Daily notes are found even when their name spells the weekday in another
  language.** A daily-note format with a locale-dependent token — `dd`, `dddd`,
  `Do` — was resolved by formatting the date in whatever locale Obsidian is
  running in now, so a note written under a different one ("Wed, 19.08.2026"
  next to a moment locale that spells it "Mi") looked missing: the day streak
  read 0, the calendar day lost its dot and the daily card offered to create a
  note that already existed. For those formats Hearth now reads the date back
  out of the filenames in the daily-note folder, ignoring the parts only the
  locale decides, so notes made by Periodic Notes with its own locale override
  — or carried over from another machine — resolve the same as any other
  (#229).
- **Filtering tasks by date honours TaskNotes' scheduled dates.** A task due
  next week but scheduled for today vanished from a **Today** filter: the card
  looked only at the due date and fell back to the scheduled one when there was
  no due date at all. **Today**, **This week**, **Overdue**, **Has a date** and
  **No date** now match on either of a task's dates, the way TaskNotes' own
  date views do, and the scheduled date is read through your TaskNotes field
  mapping rather than the literal `scheduled` key. The filter's presets are
  renamed to "Today" and "This week" to say what they now match (#225).
- **Moving one occurrence of a repeating calendar event moves it, instead of
  showing it twice.** Drag a single occurrence to another day in Google Calendar
  (or edit or delete just that one) and the calendar card listed it in both
  places at once. The feed says as much in two parts — the series keeps its
  repeat rule untouched, and a second entry carries the same event with the
  original time it replaces — and Hearth read those as two separate events.
  Hearth now folds the second entry back into the series: the occurrence appears
  where you moved it and nowhere else, a deleted one disappears, and an edit
  that takes over "this and all following events" splits the series at that
  point (#232).
- **Recent files shows every file you asked for — or as many as the card is
  tall.** Setting **Number of files** to 15 listed ten and left the rest of the
  card empty, because Obsidian's own recent-files list stops at ten entries and
  no amount of asking afterwards makes it longer. Hearth now keeps its own
  recent-file history — up to 50 files, deduplicated, most recent first, stored
  per vault on this machine like Obsidian's own and following renames — so a
  larger number is a number the card can actually fill. The setting is clamped
  to what that history holds rather than accepting a value it would quietly
  ignore. And a new **Fit to card height** toggle lists as many files as the
  card has room for, so a tall card fills instead of ending in a band of unused
  space, and resizing it changes how many appear.

### Changed

- **Low power mode is now a four-step performance tier.** One switch used to
  take the wallpaper, the frosted glass, every animation and every refresh
  timer away together — far more than most people need to give up, which is why
  it rescued nobody from the power draw it was meant to fix. Settings →
  Appearance → **Performance** now ladders it:

  - **Full** — everything on.
  - **Balanced** — the painted sky is drawn at half density: fewer raindrops,
    stars, clouds and fog wisps. Nothing is switched off, there is simply less
    of it, for roughly half the cost.
  - **Reduced** — nothing moves and no frosted glass, but the wallpaper stays,
    cards stay translucent, and every refresh timer keeps running.
  - **Minimal** — the former low power mode.

  Card auto-refresh is no longer tangled up with animation, so a board on
  **Reduced** holds still and still stays up to date, and translucency parts
  company with the blur so cards still read as glass. An existing low power
  mode setting folds into the ladder on upgrade.

  Underneath, the animations themselves got much cheaper. The pet sprite and
  the painted sky animated a CSS transform on an SVG element, which Chromium
  will not composite — every frame recalculated style on the main thread, and
  for the sky laid out as well. The pet now animates a wrapper `div` instead:
  measured over four seconds with four pets, 123.6 ms of main-thread time and
  239 style recalculations became 4.2 ms and none. Motion is also paused when
  nobody can see it — a board in an unfocused window (**Pause animation when
  unfocused**, on by default, desktop only) and a card scrolled off screen or
  clipped away by a fit-to-page board. Pausing freezes each animation where it
  stood rather than clearing it, so regaining focus resumes instead of
  snapping the sky and the pet back to their static positions. And
  `prefers-reduced-motion` is now honoured board-wide rather than by the three
  features that had their own rules for it. Card blur defaults to 0 for new
  vaults; existing vaults keep the value they have (#223).

- **Deprecated Obsidian APIs cleared out of the settings UI.** Hearth no longer
  calls `setDynamicTooltip()` on its sliders: Obsidian draws a slider's value
  inline itself as of 1.13, where the call did nothing. On Obsidian 1.8.7–1.12.x
  — still Hearth's declared minimum — a slider now shows no number while you
  drag it; the value it lands on is the one the setting keeps, as before.

- **"What's new" reads as a list of headlines, not a wall of text.** The dialog
  after an update — and **View changelog** in Settings → About — now shows one
  line per change, grouped under **New**, **Fixed** and **Changed** with a
  count per group beside the version, and folds each explanation away until you
  click the line you care about. A release you aren't reading collapses to a
  single row, so upgrading across several versions is a short list rather than
  several screens of prose, and a filter box searches every headline *and* its
  detail. The issue a change closes sits beside it as a link to GitHub. It is
  the same `CHANGELOG.md` as before, and still the only source: nothing is
  rewritten or summarised, only folded.

## [2.1.0]

### Added

- **A launchpad that makes notes: the Templater card.** Hearth's third tile card
  sits beside Links and Commands, but each of its buttons creates a note. A tile
  carries three things — one of your
  [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) templates, the folder
  the note goes in, and what it is called — and one click makes it.

  **The destination is the point.** Templater's own per-template commands drop
  the note wherever Obsidian's "Default location for new notes" says, so the
  same template can only ever land in one place. A tile carries its own folder,
  so *Meeting* → `Work/Meetings`, *Book note* → `Library`, and *Idea* → `Inbox`
  are three buttons over one or three templates, whichever you have.

  **Filenames are patterns.** `{{date}}`, `{{date:YYYY-MM}}`, `{{time}}` and
  `{{time:HH-mm}}` are substituted when the tile is clicked, and `{{prompt}}`
  asks you for the rest of the name first — so `Meeting {{date}} — {{prompt}}`
  is one click and one line typed. Leave the field empty and Templater names the
  note, as it does from its own command.

  **Templater does the templating.** Hearth calls
  `create_new_note_from_template` on the running plugin and nothing else: your
  user scripts, `tp.system.prompt()` dialogs, folder templates and
  `tp.file.cursor()` placement all behave exactly as they do everywhere else.
  What Hearth adds is where the note *opens* — through its own "Open notes in"
  setting, so a click from the dashboard no longer replaces the dashboard.

  Tiles drag, resize and overlap like every other launchpad tile, take a Lucide
  icon or a vault image, and can be told to file the note away silently instead
  of opening it. The template picker lists Templater's own template folder. And
  the setup wizard offers the card on a fresh install, seeded with a button per
  template you already have.

- **A setup wizard that builds your first dashboard.** A new install no longer
  lands on a generic starter grid and a wallpaper nobody chose. Hearth asks
  instead — a title and logo, a card style and a background, what you actually
  use the vault for, how it should behave on startup — and lays out a board from
  the answers.

  **It looks before it asks.** Every supported plugin that is installed and
  enabled in *your* vault is offered on its own step, each with the single
  concrete thing accepting it will do: TaskNotes and Kanban configure a Tasks
  card, Dataview and Datacore add a card seeded with an editable query, Git adds
  a Git card, Omnisearch becomes the search bar's engine, Iconic/Iconize turn on
  your own file icons, a `.base` in the vault gets embedded, and Daily notes and
  Bookmarks add the matching cards. Nothing is installed and nothing is changed
  inside the other plugin.

  **TaskNotes is read properly, not merely noticed.** Its field names are
  remappable and its statuses are user-defined, so Hearth reads the running
  plugin's own configuration — the status, due and priority properties, and
  every status it counts as complete — and copies them across. The step shows
  you exactly what it found. A vault that renamed `due` to `deadline`, or that
  treats "cancelled" as finished, gets a Tasks card that is right on its first
  render instead of one that silently shows nothing.

  **Nothing is written until you say so.** The last step draws the board to
  scale and lists every card with the answer that put it there. A board too tall
  to squeeze onto one screen is set to scroll rather than being scaled down to
  nothing — as an override on that board alone.

  **And it says so up front.** The final step *opens* by saying that the board
  it is about to build is a starting point rather than a preset: enough to show
  what Hearth can do for you, but only a fraction of what there is. Every card
  can be moved, resized, retitled, recoloured, reconfigured or thrown out, and
  there is a great deal more in the settings than the wizard asks about — so go
  and edit all of it to your liking.

  Run it again any time from **Settings → Hearth → About → Build a dashboard**
  or the **Set up Hearth** command. Run that way it **always adds a new
  dashboard** and never touches an existing one, so it is safe to press just to
  see what it would make. Only the first-run prompt offers to replace the
  untouched starter board.

  Existing vaults are never interrupted: the wizard is offered only to an
  install with no saved Hearth settings at all, and dismissing it counts as an
  answer, so it can't nag.

- **A board that wears its background as a banner.** **Appearance → Background →
  Background layout** offers a second way to show the backdrop you already have:
  instead of filling the view, it is cropped into a strip across the top of the
  board — a cover image, the way one sits above a note — and the cards sit below
  it on your theme's own surface.

  It is the same background either way. The kind, the value, the opacity and the
  blur all mean exactly what they meant before, a live weather sky included, so
  switching between the two is one dropdown and loses nothing. What the banner
  adds is its own shape: **how tall** the strip is, whether its lower edge
  **fades** into the page or ends on a line, and whether it **lines up with the
  content** or runs edge to edge.

  **Every board chooses for itself**, in its own settings under **Background**.
  The layout and each part of the banner's shape are separate overrides, and
  each one either follows the vault or doesn't — so a board can wear the
  wallpaper you already have as a banner without restating the picture, keep a
  full background while the rest of the vault has moved to banners, or set its
  own height and let the fade and width follow along. Every control says which
  it is doing, and resets to following the vault.

  On a fit-to-page board the grid simply takes the height the banner leaves it.
  Low power mode still replaces the picture with its flat colour, but it now
  leaves the *layout* alone: a bannered board keeps its banner, so toggling the
  mode no longer moves every card on it.

- **Lucide icons for the tab and the title.** Hearth's crystal is no longer the
  only mark it can wear. **Appearance → Home → Tab icon** picks any Lucide icon
  for Hearth's tab header and ribbon button, and **Title icon** does the same for
  the icon beside the big title on the board. Leave either empty and nothing
  changes: the crystal, and the emoji/text logo, stay exactly as they were.

  **Each dashboard can set its own title icon**, under **Header → Title icon** in
  that board's settings — one board a flame, the next a rocket, or one board back
  to the plain logo text while the vault-wide setting shows an icon.

  **Every icon field is now a picker.** Type an id if you know it, or press the
  magnifier and search the whole Lucide set with each icon drawn beside its name;
  a preview beside the field shows what you'll get. That applies to the dashboard
  switcher's icon too, which until now was an id typed from memory. An id that
  names no icon falls back — to the crystal, the logo text, or the switcher's
  number — rather than leaving a blank where the icon should be.

- **The calculator converts number bases.** Binary, octal, decimal and hex now
  read and write in the same grammar as every other conversion:
  `FF hex to decimal` → `255`, `1010 binary to hex` → `0xA`, `377 octal in
  decimal` → `255`. A bare number is decimal, as it is everywhere else in the
  card, so plain arithmetic converts too — `20 + 35 to hex` → `0x37`.

  Results carry the notation you'd paste back into code (`0xFF`, `0b1010`,
  `0o377`), and the card reads that notation back: `0xFF to decimal` works
  without naming the source base. Negative values keep a sign in front of the
  digits (`-0xA`) rather than wrapping into two's complement at a bit width the
  card never asked you for.

- **An embedded picture can be framed, not just embedded.** An image embed used
  to render at whatever size the picture happened to be, in a box that scrolled
  — a wide photo in a short card showed a sliver of itself. The embed card's
  Content tab now offers the usual choices for any picture target, on the
  primary view and the second view alike:

  - **Fit the whole picture** — scaled down whole, letterboxed if it has to be.
  - **Fill the card (crop)** — the whole card, edge to edge, cropping the
    overflow.
  - **Stretch to the card** — both edges pinned, aspect ratio be damned.
  - **Fit the width (scroll)** — full width, its own height, scroll for the rest.
  - **Original size** — what image embeds have always done, and still the
    default, so no existing card changes.

  **Picture position** anchors the picture to any of nine points, which is what
  decides *which part* a crop keeps — a portrait cropped to a wide card can hold
  onto the face instead of the middle. **Zoom** now works inside the frame too:
  zooming a cropped picture crops in further rather than scrolling the box.

- **A slideshow card.** **Notes & files → Slideshow** is the image embed with
  more than one picture: it shows them in turn, on a timer you set. Choose the
  pictures one by one — each can carry its own caption, and the list can be
  reordered by hand — or point the card at a folder and let every image in it
  (optionally including subfolders) play, so a card fills itself as you drop
  photos in.

  **The order is yours**: your own list order, by name, by date created or
  modified (either direction), or shuffled — a shuffled card reshuffles between
  passes, so it shows everything once per round without settling into the same
  running order forever.

  **And so is the way pictures change**: a plain cut, a crossfade, a slide or a
  zoom, over as long as you like, with an optional slow zoom into each picture
  while it is held. Pictures either fill the card or fit whole inside it, the
  caption can be shown over them, and hovering brings up previous / pause / next
  with the position. It rotates two `<img>` layers no matter how many pictures
  there are, so a folder of hundreds costs the same as a pair — and it respects
  low power mode and a reduced-motion preference, holding still rather than
  animating.

### Fixed

- **Arranging a fit-to-page board keeps the arrangement.** On a board whose
  cards are taller than the pane — which is what happens as soon as you zoom
  Obsidian in, so it depended on your screen and zoom level rather than on
  anything you did — cards no longer jump when you finish arranging. The board
  squeezes the layout vertically to fit one screen, but a drag or resize was
  stored as the *squeezed* pixels, so the squeeze was applied a second time on
  the next draw: the card landed above where you dropped it, shorter than you
  made it, gaps between neighbours narrowed, and every further arrange session
  walked the whole board a little further up. The stored geometry is now
  converted back out of the fit, so a card stays exactly where you put it.
- **Snapping works at every zoom level.** On the same fitted boards, the
  magnetic alignment guides were computed from the cards' unsqueezed positions
  while you were dragging against their visible edges, so edges tens of pixels
  away never came close enough to snap — matching a neighbour's height or edge
  was simply impossible until you zoomed back out. Guides now come from where
  the cards actually are on screen. A dragged card also no longer jolts to a
  different position the instant it starts moving.
- **Cards wait for you to finish typing before they refresh.** A card that
  tracks a file redraws when that file changes on disk — but if the thing
  changing it was you, typing into a field the card itself is showing, the
  redraw took the field (and your cursor) with it. Plugin-rendered inputs inside
  an embedded note are the clearest case: every write went back into the note,
  and a moment later the card reloaded under your hands, so finishing a sentence
  meant clicking back in over and over. A card now holds a refresh while a field
  inside it has focus and catches up once you click away — exactly when you want
  it to. The same wait applies to **Live refresh on vault changes**, which
  rebuilt the whole board out from under the same field.

## [2.0.0]

### Added

- **A real calendar card.** **Planning → Calendar** is the calendar you look at
  to plan a day, next to the mini calendar's month-at-a-glance. It draws four
  views and the toolbar switches between them without leaving the board:
  **Month**, where every day cell lists its events by name (with “+N more” when
  a day is busy); **Week** and **Day**, a scrolling time grid where each event
  sits at its own hour, overlapping ones split into side-by-side columns, all-day
  items ride in a band across the top, and a red line marks the current time;
  and **List**, the days ahead with their events under them.

  **It reads your calendars, not a second copy of them.** Sources are exactly
  the mini calendar's: ICS/iCal subscriptions, TaskNotes (scheduled tasks, due
  dates, recurring occurrences, timeblocks and the calendars subscribed inside
  it), and your daily notes — days that already have one are marked, and a day's
  number opens or creates it. Clicking an event opens the same details popup,
  with the same **Create note** action behind it.

  **The defaults are the point.** Out of the box it opens on the month, follows
  Obsidian's language for the week start and the clock, draws the *whole* day in
  the time grid — nothing can hide outside the visible hours — and scrolls
  itself to the first event of the day rather than to midnight. When you do want
  to change something, it is all there: which views the switcher offers (down to
  one, which hides the switcher), the week start, hidden weekends, week numbers,
  a 12- or 24-hour clock, named chips or bare dots in the month and how many
  before the rest collapse, the hours the time grid draws and how tall an hour
  is, the current-time line, and how far the list reaches. Anything you push
  outside the drawn hours moves into the all-day band instead of disappearing.

  Where you have navigated to is remembered while Obsidian is open, so saving a
  note no longer snaps the calendar back to this month.

- **The weather sky, as your background.** **Settings → Appearance →
  Background** has a new type: **Live weather sky**. The board's backdrop
  becomes the painted sky the weather card's artistic style draws — sun,
  crescent moon and a full field of stars, clouds drifting in three lanes,
  rain, drizzle, snow, layered fog and lightning — spread across the whole
  window and following the real conditions and the real time of day over a
  place you pick. The storm and the fog were rebuilt for the size: lightning
  is now several generated discharges, each a crooked forked stroke on its own
  timer over a sheet flash, rather than one drawn bolt blinking in one spot;
  fog is a bank of overlapping wisps drifting past each other at different
  speeds and densities, rather than three flat bands. It is the same painting, redrawn for the space: a window is
  several times a card, so it gets a wider box, more stars, more clouds and
  more rain rather than three enormous clouds. Pick the place by searching for
  it or by typing coordinates, or reuse one already set on a weather card in
  one click; the forecast is shared with any card on the same place instead of
  fetched twice, and refreshes itself every half hour.

  **Or pin a sky and keep it.** Set the sky to *fixed* instead of live and
  choose the condition yourself — always clear, always snow, always
  thunderstorm — and whether it follows your clock or stays permanently day or
  night. A fixed sky needs no location and never goes online at all.

  Backgrounds can be set globally or per dashboard, so one board can sit under
  a live sky and another under a permanent clear night. Opacity and blur work
  as they do for a wallpaper (switching to a sky lifts the photo-oriented
  default opacity once, since a gradient dimmed to 0.35 is just a grey slab).
  Low power mode still replaces the whole background with its flat colour, and
  a reader whose system asks for reduced motion gets the sky without the
  motion.
- **Weather card.** Current conditions and a forecast on the dashboard, from
  [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) — free, key-less, and with no account to
  create, so it works the moment you add the card. Point it at a place by
  searching for it (the name lookup happens once, in the card's settings; only
  the resolved coordinates are ever sent afterwards) or by typing coordinates
  yourself. **Five styles** take it from plain to painted: *Minimal* is one
  glyph and one temperature; *Compact* is a single row with the condition and
  the place; *Detailed* adds a grid of metrics; *Forecast* draws the hourly
  temperature as a curve with a daily strip beneath it; and *Artistic* fills the
  card edge to edge with a sky that follows the real weather and the real time
  of day — sun, crescent moon and stars, clouds drifting in three lanes, falling
  rain, drizzle and snow, fog banks and a lightning flash. **What it shows is
  yours to choose**: place name, condition, feels-like, today's high and low,
  humidity, wind (with a compass point), precipitation, UV, pressure, sunrise
  and sunset, the last-updated time, and how many hours and days the strips
  cover. Units are separate — Celsius or Fahrenheit, four wind units,
  millimetres or inches, and a 12- or 24-hour clock. Forecasts are cached and
  shared between cards, a stale reading is kept when the network is gone rather
  than blanking the card, the sky stops animating in low power mode, and the
  whole thing goes quiet under **Settings → Behaviour → Disable external
  calls**. Open-Meteo joins the Integrations catalogue.
- **Pet card.** A pixel-art companion that follows how much you write. Pick an
  animal — cat, dog, bird, fox, frog or blob — name it, and set its two colors;
  the outline, shading and belly are derived from the body color, and the whole
  sprite is drawn from a 16×16 character grid, so the card ships no images at
  all. Its mood comes from the vault, not from a timer: notes edited (or
  created) today against thresholds you set make it content, happy or bouncing
  with joy, and a quiet day leaves it slouched and bored, then curled up
  asleep once the vault has been still for a while, draining of color, with
  drifting z's. That is the entire ladder —
  there is no hunger, no age, no illness and no way to lose it, so a fortnight
  away from the vault costs nothing but a nap. Click the pet to pet it: hearts,
  and a stretch of guaranteed happiness.

  **Every rung is yours to set.** Where excited, happy and content begin, how
  long the vault must stay quiet before the pet sleeps, and how long a petting
  lasts. Set them however you like — they are always read back in climbing
  order, so no combination leaves a mood the pet can't reach.

  **It looks at you, and it knows what time it is.** The pet's eyes follow
  your pointer — over its own card, or anywhere on the dashboard, or not at
  all, as you like — by shifting under a pixel, snapped to the grid, with the
  face drawn whole underneath so nothing tears. A sleeping pet keeps its eyes
  shut. And a quiet small hour now reads as the hour rather than as neglect:
  in the night window you set, a bored or merely content pet goes to sleep
  under a moon instead of its z's, or the pet sleeps through the window
  whatever the day held, or the clock is ignored entirely. A good day still
  shows as a good day at midnight, and petting always wakes the pet.

  **And it sleeps when the vault does.** After a stretch with nothing touched
  anywhere in the vault — yours to set — the pet falls asleep whatever its
  mood and however good the day was, and any activity at all wakes it back to
  the rung the day earned.

  Each mood is drawn animation, not one picture being wobbled: the pet blinks,
  glances aside, wags its head, squashes as it lands from a hop and breathes in
  its sleep, from frames generated out of that single drawing. Everything is
  recomputed from file timestamps on each draw, so a synced `data.json`, a
  closed laptop or a device you have not opened in a month can never leave the
  pet out of step. Low power mode and a reduced-motion preference keep the pet
  perfectly still — the mood is in its posture and its face.
- **Git card.** If your vault is a repository kept by the
  [Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) plugin, the dashboard can now
  show and drive it. The card puts the branch, the staged and changed files, the
  unpushed commit count, the time of the last commit and the recent log on the
  board, and gives you buttons for **commit-and-sync, commit, push, pull, fetch,
  stage all, unstage all, discard all** and **switch branch**, plus one-click
  ways into the Git plugin's own source-control and history panels.
  Right-clicking a changed file offers its diff, staging, unstaging and discard;
  clicking one opens the note.

  **None of it is a second git client.** Every action is the Git plugin doing
  the work, queued on that plugin's own task queue — so your remote,
  credentials, commit-message template, submodule and backup settings all apply
  exactly as they do from the command palette, a card button can't interleave
  with an automatic backup, and errors surface where you already expect them.
  The card follows the Git plugin's own events instead of polling, so it moves
  in step with its source-control view, including after an automatic backup.

  **Built to be arranged.** Choose which of the four sections the card stacks
  (status, buttons, changed files, recent commits) and which buttons it offers,
  in which order, as icons or icons with labels. Decide what a commit from the
  card covers — staged-if-anything-is-staged (what the Git plugin itself does),
  everything, or only staged — give it a fixed commit message or let the plugin
  prompt for one each time, cap the file and commit lists, and turn on folder
  paths or an extra timed re-read for a repo that also changes outside Obsidian.
  Discarding asks first unless you say otherwise. The card is offered whether or
  not the Git plugin is installed — without it, the card says so and points at
  it — and Git joins the Integrations catalogue.
- **Datacore card.** Dataview is winding down in favour of
  [Datacore](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore), so Hearth now has a card
  for it, in the same shape as the Dataview card: pick a query type, write a
  query, get a live result. **Query** is the no-code mode — type a Datacore
  query like `@page and #project` and the card renders the matches as a list of
  links that re-runs itself whenever the index changes, with optional paging.
  The other four modes run the text as a Datacore script (JSX, JS, TSX or TS),
  exactly as inside a `datacorejsx` block, so anything you can draw in a note —
  tables, cards, interactive views — you can put on the dashboard. A query with
  a syntax error says so on the card instead of failing silently, and the card
  is offered whether or not Datacore is installed — without it, the card says so
  and points at it. Datacore also joins the Integrations catalogue.
- **Every integration in one place.** **Settings → Integrations** now opens with
  a complete catalogue of everything Hearth works with — community plugins
  (Omnisearch, TaskNotes, Dataview, Git, Iconic, Iconize, Excalidraw), Obsidian's own
  core plugins (Bases, Canvas, Daily notes, Bookmarks, Search, File explorer,
  Workspaces, Audio recorder, plus any plugin whose side panel a Plugin view
  card can host) and the external services some cards fetch from (Jira, RSS and Atom
  feeds, iCalendar subscriptions, exchange rates, web search). Every one is
  listed whether or not it's installed, so the tab answers "what does Hearth
  work with?" and not just "what did I already set up". Each row says what the
  integration does, carries a live status (enabled, disabled, not installed),
  and points at where its settings actually live — the section below on that
  tab, another tab (Omnisearch is a choice in the search-engine dropdown), the
  card itself, the other plugin's own settings, or nowhere at all. Rows link
  straight there, and anything not installed gets a one-click Install button.
- **Low power mode.** One switch at the top of **Settings → Appearance** trades
  Hearth's visual effects for battery life and smoothness on slower hardware.
  While it is on the background becomes a flat colour (a muted grey-purple by
  default, and you can change it) instead of an image, GIF, opacity layer and
  blur; cards go opaque with no frosted glass behind them; transitions, hover
  lifts, shadows and animations stop; clock cards drop seconds and the sweeping
  second hand; and every timed background refresh pauses — web, RSS, calendar
  subscriptions, Jira and the live dashboard refresh all still load on open and
  on a manual refresh, they just stop waking the app up on a clock. Nothing is
  overwritten: the mode is an override, so your background, opacity and blur
  settings sit exactly where you left them (dimmed, with a note) and come back
  unchanged the moment you switch it off — per-dashboard and per-card overrides
  included.
- **Choose what a calendar entry shows.** A new **Entry details** section in the
  calendar card's settings (agenda layout) switches each chip on an entry on or
  off: the time, the calendar name, and — with TaskNotes as a source — the
  task's status, its priority, and the due / recurring / timeblock markers. On a
  narrow card the markers competed with the title itself; now every card shows
  only what earns its space. Existing cards are unchanged: everything the agenda
  already showed stays on, and the status chip (new, and only available here) is
  off until asked for.
- **TaskNotes as a calendar source.** A calendar card can now pick up your
  TaskNotes calendar and show it as a calendar card: scheduled tasks (sized by
  their time estimate), due dates, recurring tasks unrolled into one entry per
  occurrence, timeblocks from daily notes, and the ICS calendars subscribed
  inside TaskNotes itself. Everything is read the way TaskNotes reads it — its
  field mapping, its tag-or-property rule for what counts as a task, its custom
  statuses and priorities with their colours — and each layer defaults to
  whatever TaskNotes' own calendar is showing, so switching the source on
  mirrors your existing setup. Per card you can override any layer, hide
  completed or archived tasks, colour entries by status, priority or one fixed
  colour, and give due dates and timeblocks their own colours. Completed tasks
  show struck through with a faded day dot; a checkbox on each agenda entry
  completes it in place (per-occurrence for recurring tasks, exactly as
  TaskNotes records it), and the event popup shows the task's status, priority,
  contexts, projects and estimate with an **Open task** button that hands off to
  TaskNotes' own editor.
- **Choose where Hearth opens notes.** Settings → Hearth → Behaviour → **Opening
  notes** has a single **Open notes in** choice that governs every note Hearth
  opens: **a new tab** (what it has always done), **the current tab**, which
  replaces the home view so Hearth behaves like any other tab and the back
  arrow brings it straight back, **a split pane**, or **a new window**. Four
  optional rows under it take exceptions, each starting on *Same as above*, so
  links, search results, notes listed in cards and notes Hearth creates can each
  land somewhere different — a search hit taking over the Hearth tab while a
  link from a card opens beside it. Ctrl/Cmd-click still opens a new tab
  whatever the setting says, and the modifier combinations Obsidian understands
  for a split or a window work here too.

  A last row covers what Hearth doesn't control: **Notes opened from outside
  Hearth** — the file explorer, the quick switcher, the graph — which Obsidian
  hands to whichever tab is focused, taking a Hearth tab over. It still does by
  default (the dashboard acts like an ordinary tab, and the explorer's selection
  follows what you open), but set it to **A new tab** and the Hearth tab is left
  alone. Links inside an embedded Bases table now follow the **Links** rule too,
  instead of always replacing the dashboard (#106).
- **An embedded note can be opened in its own tab.** Note embed cards have a new
  **Open button** toggle in their card settings; turned on, a button on the card
  opens the embedded file properly — following the open-behaviour setting above.
  Off by default, so no existing board changes (#144).
- **Build your own task fields.** Turn on **Customize task fields** under
  Settings → Hearth → Integrations and the fixed metadata Tasks cards show is
  replaced by fields you define yourself. You start from a blank slate — a task
  shows its text and nothing else — and add fields one at a time:

  - **Name** the field, and choose how it's drawn: a **chip**, a bare
    **colored dot**, or **plain text**.
  - Give it a **key**: any frontmatter property, or one of the values Hearth
    reads itself (a checkbox line's ⏫ priority, a Kanban board column, a due
    date, the TaskNotes status). A field can have several keys, and each one
    that has a value shows one — so related metadata can live under one name.
  - **Map values** to nicer labels and colors: `high` → *Urgent* in red, `p2` →
    *Normal* in blue. A value you haven't mapped still shows, as itself, so
    nothing goes missing while you're still building the mapping up. Priority is
    matched in every spelling it comes in, so mapping `high` also catches a ⏫
    line — and mapping the exact word your notes use (`urgent`, `p1`) keeps its
    own label and color.

  - Or have the value **color the whole task** instead of adding anything to
    it: **tint** its background or **glow** around it, at a strength you set.
    An overdue task can turn the row red without a chip anywhere on it, which
    is legible across a whole board at a glance.

  **Dates know they're dates.** A date key has no values to map — instead you
  color and label it by where it falls: **before today**, **today**, **after
  today**. Leave the label empty to keep the date's own wording and just tint
  it. A frontmatter property holding a date can be marked as one, and gets the
  same treatment.

  **Click a value to change it**, in the list and on a board alike: the chip
  opens a menu of your mapped values (under their own labels), then the other
  values that key takes elsewhere in your vault, then a free entry for anything
  new and a clear. A date opens a **calendar** instead, with today / tomorrow /
  next week shortcuts. Frontmatter is written to the task's own note, so this is
  offered on TaskNotes tasks and notes made from a Kanban card; a plain checkbox
  gets it for its priority and dates, which live on the line.

  The switch is **off by default**, and while it's off every Tasks card renders
  exactly as it always has. The fields you define in Settings apply to every
  Tasks card; an individual card can define its own instead, from that card's
  settings (#157).
- **Editable notes can use Obsidian's Live Preview editor.** An editable Note
  embed or Daily note card has a new **Live preview** toggle beside
  **Editable**. Turned on, the card hosts Obsidian's own editor instead of
  Hearth's plain raw-Markdown box: formatting renders as you type, there's no
  double-click to get into edit mode, and links, embeds, undo and your editor
  plugins all behave exactly as they do in a normal tab. The card's own settings
  make the choice per card and per embed view, so a scratchpad can stay in raw
  source while a journal card reads like a page. Like the plugin-view card, the
  hosted editor is only alive while the card is on screen, and pending
  keystrokes are flushed to the vault before it's torn down. Left off, the card
  keeps the double-click raw editor it has always had (#160).
- **A real picker for adding cards.** **Arrange → Add card** no longer drops a
  single column of thirty bare names down the side of the screen. It opens a
  browser instead: a **search field** that matches names *and* descriptions (so
  "todo" finds Tasks and "iframe" finds the web card), a rail of **categories** —
  Notes & files, Planning, Vault insight, Tools, Integrations, Fun — and a grid
  of tiles where every card says in one line what it actually shows. The
  category you were last in is where it reopens, arrow keys walk the grid, and
  on a phone the rail folds into a row of chips above the tiles.
- **Request a card, from inside the picker.** The last entry in the rail is
  **Request a card**, for the moment you have looked through the whole catalogue
  and the card you wanted isn't in it. It offers two routes — a **GitHub issue**,
  opened on Hearth's feature-request form, or an **email** to the maintainer —
  and both open pre-filled: a few prompts about what the card should show and
  where its data would come from, plus your Hearth and Obsidian versions. Edit
  anything before you send it.
- **A search bar you can put anywhere on the board.** **Vault insight → Search
  bar** is the header's search field as a card — the same field, not a lesser
  copy of it, so `#tag`, `key:value` and `>` for commands all work, Omnisearch
  is used when you have routed search to it, body matches and recent files
  appear as they do above, and the arrow keys walk the results. When the field
  sits low on the board the results open upwards instead of running off the
  bottom.

  **The card is the size control.** The field fills whatever height the card
  has, so you make the bar chunkier or slimmer by dragging the card's edge in
  Arrange — no slider, and it starts thicker than the header's. Four things are
  yours to set: its own **placeholder** (blank keeps the global one), the
  **filter row** of file-type chips underneath — and, chip by chip, *which* of
  them this card offers, so a narrow bar can carry the two or three that earn
  their place rather than every type the vault happens to hold — an optional
  **button** beside the field (**New note** or **Search online**, the same two
  the header offers), and **Seamless**.

  **Seamless** is the one to try: the card stops looking like one. No border, no
  background, no title row — just the search bar, standing on the board on its
  own. It still drags, resizes and configures like any other card, and while you
  are arranging, the dashed outline every card gets marks where it is.

- **Turn the header search bar off — everywhere, or on one board.**
  **Settings → Appearance → Home** has a new **Show search section** toggle,
  right below **Show title**, that hides the search and command bar, its
  results and its filter buttons across the whole vault. Each dashboard still
  gets the last word: the board's search setting has moved to its **Header**
  tab, beside **Title visibility**, and grown from an on/off switch into the
  same three-way choice the title block already offers — **Use global
  default**, **Show search** or **Hide search** — so a board can keep the bar
  while the rest of the vault does without it, or drop it while everywhere else
  keeps it. Boards that never set the option follow the global toggle, and the
  search-bar card is unaffected: it is a card, and it stays wherever you put it.
- **Card border width, per card.** The border width already settable globally
  and per dashboard is now also on a single card: the **Style** tab of a card's
  settings has a **Card border** slider beside **Card opacity** and **Card
  blur**, with the same reset button to hand the card back to the dashboard
  default. Set it to 0 to drop one card's frame — border and the line under its
  title — while the rest of the board keeps its own.
- **Dashboard settings, straight from the Arrange toolbar.** A **Dashboard
  settings** button now sits next to **Add card** while you are arranging, and
  opens the very same editor as right-clicking the board's switcher button and
  choosing **Dashboard settings…** — name, header, layout, style and
  background for the board you are on. The right-click route still works; it is
  no longer the only one.

### Fixed

- **A task field set to "Colored dot" now draws one on dates too.** A date key
  quietly fell back to plain text whichever of the two you picked, so the dot
  and the text styles rendered identically. A date now honours the dot like
  every other value: the colour its relation to today gives it — or the overdue
  red, or the recurring accent — with the date itself and its label moved into
  the tooltip.

- **A priority now takes the chip and the plain-text styles like any other
  field.** Whichever of them you picked, a priority was drawn in its own
  dot-and-label form: "Chip" produced a dot and a word rather than the filled
  chip every other field gets. Both forms are now shaped like the rest, tinted
  by the priority's level instead of needing a color set per value. The
  dot-and-label form is still there as **Colored dot with label**, offered to
  fields that read a priority — and it is still exactly what a task shows when
  field customization is off, on a board card, and in a task's quick view.

- **Only one field can tint or ring a task, and the editor now says so.** A
  task has one background and one ring, so the second field asking for "Tint
  the whole task" or "Glow around the task" silently painted nothing. Both
  options are now unavailable on every other field once one has them, naming
  the field that does; a list saved before this gets a warning on the field
  that never showed.

- **The weather card's clouds sat in the wrong place.** Every cloud carried its
  position and size in an SVG `transform` attribute and its drift in a CSS
  animation — and a CSS animation replaces the transform attribute outright.
  So the moment a sky started moving, the whole bank lost its placement and
  slid across the top edge in a row. Clouds now drift in an outer group and
  carry their position in an inner one, so a cloudy sky is a sky with clouds in
  it rather than a strip of them along the top.

- **One card can no longer take the board down with it.** A card kind is drawn
  synchronously while the dashboard builds, and in Arrange mode the drag overlay
  and resize grips are attached *after* that draw. So an exception inside one
  card's render didn't just leave that card half-drawn — it left the card
  unmovable and unresizable, and abandoned every card after it in the loop. A
  failing render is now contained: that card shows a "couldn't be drawn" state
  with the real error on the console, and the rest of the board (and its drag
  handles) come up normally.

- **Embedded bases follow the card opacity in table view.** A `.base` card in
  list or cards view faded with the board like any other card, but the table
  view stayed a solid slab: it fills its container and rows with Obsidian's base
  surface colour (it needs opaque paint so its sticky header and first column
  cover what scrolls beneath). Base embeds now clear those surfaces so the
  card's own translucent background shows through, and the sticky header is
  painted with the card's surface colour, so it fades with the card instead of
  staying opaque. Row hover and selection highlights are untouched.
- **The task filter's Status row is readable again.** With more than a handful
  of statuses — TaskNotes states, Kanban columns, your own checkbox statuses —
  the chips took the whole row and squeezed the label down to *Sta…*, then
  wrapped into a staggered, right-aligned block. Status and Priority now stack
  their chips under the label and lay them out left to right, so the label stays
  whole and the chips read as one strip however many there are. Two things that
  went with it: a preset chip (**Overdue**, **High priority**, …) now shows when
  it's on and a second click takes it back off, instead of only ever applying;
  and a status your filter still selects but that no tasks use any more keeps
  its chip, so you can switch it off rather than having to clear the whole
  filter. Chips also report their on/off state to screen readers (#164).
- **A task list keeps one task per line.** A task whose title didn't fit
  alongside its chips broke across two or three lines — the checkbox alone on
  one, the title on the next, its status, priority and dates on a third — so a
  list of tasks with mixed title lengths read as a ragged block rather than a
  list. A row now holds the checkbox and title (with the status chip beside it)
  on the left and gathers every other chip at the right edge, and the title is
  the only part that gives way: it ellipsizes instead of wrapping the row. This
  is how the list already behaved with **Customize task fields** on; both modes
  now match (#156).
- **Task checkboxes are no longer clipped in embed, daily and jot cards.** A
  task list embedded in a card could have the left edge of its checkboxes cut
  off. Obsidian hangs a checkbox outside its list item by one and a half checkbox
  widths, and sizes checkboxes from the global font-size setting — which card
  text doesn't follow — so on a larger setting the checkbox outgrew the indent
  it hangs out of and spilled past the card's edge. The card's side gutter now
  sits on the embed itself, where it can actually shield content from being
  clipped, and widens to match the checkbox instead of being a fixed number, so
  it holds at any font size. Checkboxes still scale with your font setting;
  ordinary cards look exactly as before (#137).
- **No grey box under an editable note.** Double-clicking an editable Note
  embed, Daily note or jot card to edit it dropped a grey form-field panel
  behind the text — permanently so on mobile, where Obsidian's own textarea
  rule outranked the transparent background Hearth asks for. The raw editor
  now keeps the card's surface in every state, so switching between the
  rendered note and its source no longer changes the card's background (#160).
- **Note-content search results are readable.** A hit inside a note's body
  showed the raw slice of file it was cut from, so results imported from HTML
  or carrying frontmatter came out as a wall of `&quot;`, `&#039;` and `<br>`
  with `["Novák Jan", "Šikl Tomáš"]` quoting in the middle of it — and the whole
  line was accent-coloured, so it shouted as loudly as the file name above it.
  Excerpts are now cleaned before they're shown (HTML and entities decoded,
  frontmatter fences, heading, quote and bullet markers dropped, links reduced
  to their text, inline YAML lists unquoted), narrowed to the text around the
  match, and rendered as muted context with only the matched words highlighted.
  Omnisearch results go through the same treatment and highlight the words it
  reports matching, so both engines read the same way.
- **Search results are ranked by how well they actually match.** Obsidian's
  fuzzy matcher will scatter a query's letters across a long string and score
  the result respectably, so searching `banán` returned
  *Pohan**á**kový chlé**b** s **a**vokádovo-vaječ**n**ou pom**a**zá**n**kou* and
  *Library/Recipes/Polévka z pečených **b**atátů s cizr**n**ou **a** kukuřicí* —
  ranked above notes that plainly contain the word *banánu*. Results are now
  banded, and **every literal match outranks every fuzzy one**: a name starting
  with what you typed, then the query at a word start in the name, then anywhere
  in the name, then in the folder path, then in the note's body, and only then a
  fuzzy name match. Paths are matched literally and never fuzzily, so a folder
  search still works but can no longer conjure hits out of scattered letters.
- **Note-content matches take their place in the list.** They were appended
  after every name match, so a note whose body plainly contained the word ranked
  below every note whose title merely fuzzy-matched it — and when scattered
  titles filled the page, content search was given no room to run at all and the
  real matches never appeared. Body hits are now merged into the ranking, and
  only results that genuinely outrank them reserve a slot.
- **Accents no longer have to be typed exactly.** `banan` now finds *Banánové
  Snickersky* and highlights `Banán` in it, in file names, note bodies and
  Omnisearch results alike — matching ignores case and diacritics throughout.
- **Omnisearch results highlight the matched words again.** Omnisearch reports
  the words it matched stemmed and stripped of their accents (`banan` for a note
  that says *Banánové*), so looking for them literally found nothing and both
  the title and the excerpt came back unhighlighted. Hearth now also reads the
  spans Omnisearch itself marked in the excerpt — which carry the words exactly
  as the note spells them — and matches without accents on top of that.
- **Searching with the folders filter no longer comes up empty on Omnisearch.**
  Omnisearch indexes notes only, so with it selected as the search engine the
  folders chip could never match anything and every query answered "no matches".
  Folder searches now go to the built-in engine whichever engine is selected.
- **A saved-search card no longer lists folders you can't open.** The Query
  card's rows open a note when clicked, but folder hits were listed too and did
  nothing. It now searches files only.
- **Omnisearch failing is no longer shown as "no matches".** If Omnisearch was
  disabled mid-query or its API threw, the dropdown emptied as though the note
  didn't exist. Hearth now quietly answers with its own engine instead.

### Changed

- **Every card is in the picker, always.** Cards backed by a community plugin —
  Dataview, Datacore, Git — used to be *hidden* from the "Add card" menu until
  their plugin happened to be installed, so a third of the catalogue was
  invisible to the people most likely to want to know it existed: you could not
  find out Hearth had a Git card without already having the Git plugin. They are
  all listed now, marked **Needs Dataview** (or Datacore, or Git) while the
  plugin is missing, with a one-click jump to it in Obsidian's plugin browser
  when you add one. Nothing about the cards themselves changed — each one has
  always explained what it needs, in place on the board.
- **Searching note contents costs a lot less on a large vault.** A body search
  walked every note and built a lower-cased copy of it to match against, and the
  walk kept going after you'd typed the next character — so a few keystrokes
  left several full-vault reads racing each other, each allocating a second copy
  of the vault. A stale scan is now abandoned as soon as the query moves on, and
  folded bodies are cached (bounded, and re-read when a note changes), so
  refining a query re-uses the work the last one did.
- **The Plugin view card now says plainly how expensive it is.** Its performance
  hint was a line of muted grey text under the type dropdown, easy to skim past
  when it is the one card that can genuinely slow a dashboard down. It is now a
  warning callout that spells out why: the card runs another plugin's full view
  live, keeping that plugin's timers, listeners and rendering going for as long
  as the board is open, and every extra card costs again. With low power mode on
  it adds that this is the card that mode can't help with.
- **Links inside tasks now open where every other link does.** A `[[wikilink]]`
  in a task's text took over the current tab, which in a Hearth tab meant
  replacing the home view — while the same link on a card opened a new tab. Both
  now follow **Open notes in** (a new tab by default). To keep tasks behaving as
  they did, set **Links** under Settings → Hearth → Behaviour → Opening notes to
  *The current tab* (#106).
- **Today is marked more quietly in the calendar's agenda.** The current day's
  row no longer takes a heavy accent fill that made its text hard to read.
  Today is now carried by an accent ring around the date badge plus a faint tint
  on the row, with the stronger accent wash kept for hover — so pointing at the
  row is what lights it up. The row sets both states itself, so a theme's own
  saturated hover colour can't turn today into an unreadable slab, and hover no
  longer sticks after a tap on touch devices.

## [1.18.0]

### Added

- **Your Iconic and Iconize icons now show up in Hearth.** A file that has a
  custom icon set with either plugin keeps that icon everywhere Hearth draws
  one — Recent files, Favorites, Bookmarks, saved-search cards and the search
  bar — instead of the generic file-type icon. Bookmarks pointing at a note or
  folder now also follow the file's *type* icon rather than always showing the
  same page glyph, so a bookmarked PDF or canvas looks like one. Lucide icons and emoji are both shown; a file
  using an icon from one of Iconize's downloaded icon packs keeps Hearth's own
  icon, since those are SVG files rather than named icons. Neither plugin offers
  an API, so Hearth reads their settings directly and quietly falls back to the
  file-type icon if it can't. Turn it off, or point it at a renamed Iconize
  frontmatter property, under Settings → Hearth → Integrations (#132).

### Fixed

- **Sorting tasks by priority puts Highest at the top.** The priority sort
  ranked tasks by the coarse colour bucket the priority dot uses, which lumps
  Highest in with High (and Lowest in with Low). Tasks one level apart therefore
  tied, and the order fell through to the next rule — so a High task could sit
  above a Highest one. Priority now ranks on the exact level, so all five
  Tasks-plugin levels order Highest → High → Medium → Low → Lowest, with
  unprioritised tasks last. This applies to the priority sort, the priority step
  of a custom sort, and the priority tiebreak in the default smart sort (#145).
- **Checkboxes now stay checked.** Ticking a task in an embedded note, a daily
  note or a jot card looked like it worked and was lost on the next render:
  Obsidian only writes a checkbox click back to the file inside a real preview
  view, and the boxes Hearth renders into a card were live but inert. They now
  edit their source — the note for embed and daily cards, the card's own text
  for jots — so the state sticks, whether or not the card is set to editable.
  A tick is reverted if the write can't land, and a click on a checkbox no
  longer opens the raw editor when it lands as part of a double-click (#143).
- **Theme focus rings no longer break the search bar.** Under Catppuccin (and
  any theme that styles input focus with a body-class-prefixed selector), the
  home-screen search input picked up the theme's own focus ring, so a blue
  outline hugged the text field instead of the search bar lighting up as a
  whole. Those themes' selectors outrank the plain class selectors Hearth used
  to suppress the ring. The controls that draw their own focus affordance — the
  search input, the jot/embed editors, the calculator, the card-title field and
  the task-detail title editor — now hold that suppression against any theme.
  Inputs with an ordinary border, such as the Kanban editors and the task-detail
  description field, keep the theme's ring, since for them it is the focus
  affordance (#138).

## [1.17.0]

### Added

- **Keep an open dashboard current.** A home view now re-renders when you switch
  back to its tab, so Recent, Bookmarks and query-driven cards no longer show
  stale content until the tab is closed and reopened. The first render of a leaf
  is left alone, and refreshes are skipped mid-drag/resize so arranging a board
  is never interrupted. A new opt-in **Live refresh on vault changes** Behaviour
  toggle (default off) additionally re-renders on vault create/modify/delete/
  rename — debounced to coalesce bursts — so a permanently-visible board stays
  current without switching tabs (#110).
- **Completion checkboxes for every TaskNotes task.** Task cards showed a
  checkbox on recurring TaskNotes tasks but a plain status badge on the rest, so
  a mixed card looked inconsistent. Non-recurring TaskNotes tasks now get a
  checkbox too, in both the list and Kanban layouts. In the list, ticking writes
  the card's done status and unticking restores its first open status; on a
  Kanban board, ticking advances the task to the next swimlane (and eventually
  the done column), untick returns it to the first — mirroring how completing a
  task progresses its status. The checkbox swallows pointer events so ticking it
  on a draggable card doesn't start a drag. Recurring tasks keep their
  per-occurrence checkbox; checkbox- and Kanban-source tasks are unchanged (#111).
- **Status chip on TaskNotes tasks in the list layout.** With the checkbox
  replacing the old status badge, a task's actual status — open, in-progress,
  waiting, whatever your setup uses — was no longer visible in the list; the
  checkbox only says done or not. Each TaskNotes task now carries a small status
  pill directly after its title, left-aligned against it so it reads as part of
  the task while the priority and date chips stay on the right edge. It shows
  the raw frontmatter value (capitalized for reading) with the full value in the
  tooltip, and fades along with a completed row. Checkbox- and Kanban-source
  tasks keep their existing badges.
- **Vault images as tile icons.** Launchpad and command tiles accepted only a
  Lucide icon id; they now also take a path to an image in your vault (png, jpg,
  svg, webp, …), which fills the whole tile with the label overlaid on a
  legibility scrim. A bare Lucide id never resolves to a file, so existing icons
  are untouched. The icon field in both editors gains a "?" help badge
  explaining the two accepted forms (#119).
- **Per-dashboard "Default on mobile" flag.** A dashboard can be marked as the
  mobile default from its settings (General tab), so a board tuned for a small
  screen opens on phones and tablets without becoming the desktop default. Only
  one board can hold the flag. The switch is applied in memory only, because the
  active-dashboard id is a single synced field — persisting it would drag the
  desktop's active board along on the next sync (#120).
- **"Focus search on open" option.** An opt-in Behaviour setting that puts
  keyboard focus in the search field whenever a home view opens, so a fresh
  Hearth tab can be typed into straight away. Focus is applied on open only, so
  a background refresh never steals it mid-interaction. Desktop only — the
  setting is hidden on mobile, where auto-focus would pop the on-screen keyboard
  on every open (#115).

### Fixed

- **Opening a task's note jumps to the task's line.** "Jump to Note" (and a
  click when quick view is off) landed at the top of the note, so a task buried
  in a long note meant scrolling to find it. The target line is now passed as
  ephemeral state, which Obsidian applies once the view has mounted, instead of
  a cursor move that a not-yet-laid-out editor discarded (#118).
- **Calendar events no longer shift by a day.** Weekly recurring events expanded
  their by-day rule against a locale-aware week start combined with a
  Sunday-based day offset, so in any locale whose week starts on Monday (Czech,
  most of Europe) occurrences landed on the wrong date — off by up to several
  days. The expansion is now locale-independent. The agenda view's
  today-highlight is also toned down to a thin outline and a lightly tinted day
  number; the month grid keeps its existing highlight.
- **Search filter chips no longer strand across the search bar.** With only a
  few filters, the chips were distributed edge-to-edge — one at the start, one
  in the middle, one at the end. They now sit in a left-aligned row whose gap
  shares out the leftover space, growing from 8px to 48px with the chip count
  and wrapping only once the minimum no longer fits.

### Changed

- **Kanban boards are as translucent as task lists.** The list layout draws no
  surface of its own, so a translucent or frosted card shows straight through
  it — but a Kanban board covered the same card with an opaque column plate and
  opaque cards, reading as a solid slab on an otherwise see-through board.
  Columns are now a light tint rather than a plate, and cards a translucent fill
  with their hairline border defining the edge; both scale with the board's card
  opacity, so they fade in step with the surface they sit on.
- **Default background** swapped from an animated GIF to a static wallpaper;
  the GIF was needlessly power-hungry.
- **Card architecture modularised into a registry** (internal, behaviour
  preserving). Adding a card type used to mean editing a dozen scattered
  enumerations — render and editor switches, the add-card menu, layout-import
  validation, the live-redraw set, the card cloner, locale records — most of
  which failed silently when missed. Each of the 20 card kinds is now a
  self-contained module under `src/cards/` declaring its render, editor,
  templates, liveness and clone behaviour, collected by a registry whose mapped
  type turns a missing registration into a compile error. An unknown persisted
  card kind (from a newer version, a sync conflict or a hand-edited
  `data.json`) now falls back to an inert definition rather than crashing the
  whole dashboard render, and a cloned RSS card no longer shares its sources
  array with the original (#103).

## [1.16.0]

### Added

- **Jira saved-filter card.** Connect a dashboard card to a favorite Jira saved
  filter using a bearer personal access token, then refine its issues with
  multi-select status, assignee, priority, issue type, sprint, and fix-version
  controls. The card derives options from the unrefined filter, preserves
  selected values, supports manual and automatic refresh, caches successful
  responses, and keeps REST requests constrained to the configured HTTPS Jira
  host. Portable exports omit the Jira personal access token.

## [1.15.0]

### Added

- **Calendar card — agenda layout and external ICS calendars.** The calendar
  card gains a **Layout** setting: the existing month grid, or a new **agenda**
  view that lists upcoming days (3–60 ahead) as a scrollable timeline. It can
  also **subscribe to external calendars** by ICS/iCal URL (Google, iCloud,
  Fastmail, Nextcloud, …) — add multiple sources, each with its own name and
  colour and an individual show/hide toggle. Events render as coloured dots on
  the month grid and are listed under each day in the agenda, expanded from the
  common recurrence rules (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly with interval, count,
  until, weekly by-day, and exclusions). Feeds are cached and auto-refreshed on
  a configurable interval, share the RSS card's fetch path (so they work despite
  browser CORS), and honour the global **disable external calls** privacy
  setting. `webcal://` links are accepted. Clicking a day that has events opens
  a picker so you can choose the daily note (open or create) or any event; in
  the agenda, each listed event is clickable. Either way an event opens a
  details modal showing its name, date, time, location, notes/description,
  source calendar and any link. From that modal you can **create a note from
  the event**, configured to be as flexible as you like: pick a template,
  choose the target folder and a filename pattern (`{{summary}}`, `{{date}}`,
  …), and route every event value independently — send the date/time to custom
  frontmatter properties, append the description to the body under a heading,
  or ignore a value entirely and just keep the name. Sensible defaults apply
  out of the box. The note is linked back to the event by its ID (stored in
  frontmatter), so opening the same event later reopens its note instead of
  making a duplicate. Timezone note: UTC and all-day times are exact; `TZID`
  wall-clock times are read in the viewer's local zone.
- **Vault statistics card — advanced mode.** The stats card gains an **Advanced**
  toggle in its editor. Off keeps the familiar fixed set of tiles. On unlocks
  three controls: choose which built-in stats appear (notes, attachments,
  folders, tags, day streak, and a new **Days using Obsidian** counter measured
  from the vault's oldest file); break attachments out into a separate count
  tile per file type (images, PDFs, videos, …); and add custom count tiles that
  show how many files match a query, using the search bar's syntax (`#tag`,
  `key:value` for a frontmatter property, or plain text). Each custom tile takes
  an optional label and icon.

### Fixed

- **Clock card — force a 12- or 24-hour clock regardless of locale.** The clock's
  "24-hour time" toggle only chose between 24-hour and the OS locale default, so
  on locales that already default to a 24-hour clock there was no way to get a
  12-hour clock. It is replaced by a three-way **Time format** selector
  (Automatic / 12-hour / 24-hour) mapping directly to `Intl`'s `hour12` option.
  Existing settings are migrated, preserving prior behaviour (#98).

## [1.14.0]

### Added

- **Link a dashboard to a core Workspace (auto-switch).** Each dashboard gets an
  optional linked workspace, chosen from the core Workspaces plugin's saved
  workspaces in the dashboard settings (General tab). When that workspace loads,
  Hearth switches to the linked dashboard automatically. Sync is one-way
  (workspace → dashboard) and fires once per workspace change; the link survives
  layout export/import, and duplicating a dashboard deliberately does not copy it
  (#91).
- **Theme-following crystal icon.** The ribbon, tab and header crystal is now a
  vector drawn with `currentColor`, so an optional **Follow theme icon color**
  Appearance setting (Off / Icon / Title / Icon and title) lets it track the
  theme's icon color in light and dark. The default keeps the familiar purple
  crystal (#90).
- **Plugin view card — show a specific file.** The Plugin view card can now open
  a chosen vault file in the hosted view, so file-backed views (Excalidraw,
  canvas, …) render the document instead of an empty "new file" screen. The card
  editor gains a file field with a fuzzy picker and a clear button; a blank path
  hosts the bare view as before (#89).
- **Bookmark groups (folders).** The Bookmarks card now mirrors Obsidian's own
  bookmarks pane: groups render as collapsible folders (click the header to
  expand or collapse) and sub-groups nest to any depth, instead of every
  bookmark being flattened into one list. This also fixes bookmarks inside a
  group appearing twice — the card previously re-flattened Obsidian's already
  flat `getBookmarks()` list — and drops groups left empty after orphaned
  file/folder bookmarks are hidden (#82).

### Fixed

- **Open files in place from the dashboard.** The dashboard view now marks itself
  navigable, so opening a file (from the file explorer or elsewhere) while the
  dashboard is focused reuses the tab instead of spawning a new one and leaving
  the file explorer's selection stuck (#84).
- **Unnamed bookmarks show the file name, not the full path.** A file or folder
  bookmark without its own name previously rendered as its whole vault path,
  which overflowed the card when the path was long. It now shows just the
  target's basename — matching Obsidian's own bookmarks pane — and still falls
  back to the last path segment if the target can't be resolved (#92).

## [1.13.0]

### Added

- **Per-dashboard header customization.** Each dashboard can now override the
  global header defaults — title visibility and text, logo text/icon,
  alignment, title and logo size, the title's top margin, and the spacing below
  the header block — while search visibility stays independent. Import/export
  sanitises the new fields and duplicating a dashboard preserves its explicit
  overrides (#75).
- **Editable Kanban card titles.** A Kanban card's title can now be edited in
  place: **double-click** a card to swap its text for an inline input (Enter
  saves, Escape cancels), the same gesture that renames a column. The card's
  quick-view popover (single click) also shows the title as an editable field,
  so it's reachable by keyboard too. Either way the card's dates, priority and
  repeat markers are preserved; note-linked cards keep their note's name as the
  title (#71).
- **Editable Kanban card descriptions.** A card's quick-view popover now has a
  **Description** field for every Kanban card — not just when the "Dates &
  priorities" toggle is on. The text is saved as indented sub-bullets under the
  card in the board note, or, for a card that's been converted to a note, into
  that note's body. The card's title and metadata line is left untouched (#71).
- **Card border width setting.** A new global setting controls the width of
  card borders (#78).

### Fixed

- **TaskNotes tasks open in a working editor again.** Opening an existing
  TaskNotes task from a Tasks card handed TaskNotes' edit modal the note's
  `TFile` instead of its own task object, leaving the modal with a broken
  change-detection baseline: every button but Delete was trapped and the window
  couldn't be closed (#72). Hearth now resolves TaskNotes' task info for the
  note first (via its cache manager or public API) and only opens the modal when
  it can, falling back to opening the note otherwise.

## [1.12.0]

### Changed

- **Card & dashboard settings, reorganised into tabs.** The card-settings and
  per-dashboard-settings dialogs — previously one long, flat scroll of every
  control — are now split across tabs, mirroring the plugin settings pane so the
  whole plugin configures the same way. Card settings groups into **Content**
  (type, title and the card's own options), **Style** (colours, opacity, blur)
  and **Layout** (size, pin to all dashboards, copy to another), with Remove and
  Done always in reach at the bottom. Dashboard settings groups into **General**,
  **Layout**, **Style** and **Background**. The last-used tab is remembered, and
  a single failing group can no longer blank the whole dialog.

### Added

- **Recent files card — file-type filter.** The **Recent files** card can now be
  limited to specific file types. Its editor offers the same type chips as the
  search filter (Notes, Images, PDFs, Canvas, …); pick any combination to list
  only those, or leave them all off to keep showing every recently-opened file.
- **Card corner radius setting.** A **Card corner radius** slider controls how
  rounded card corners are, from the default 14 px down to sharp 0 px corners,
  at both global (Settings → Dashboard) and per-dashboard (dashboard settings)
  levels. Merged-together cards still flatten their touching corners, and the
  shared frosted-glass layer follows the same radius so nothing seams.
- **RSS feed card — add feeds from a GitHub repo.** The RSS card's editor now
  has an **Add from GitHub** shortcut: type a repository as `owner/repo` (or
  paste its URL), pick **Releases**, **Commits**, or both, and Hearth adds the
  matching `releases.atom` / `commits.atom` feeds for you — no need to
  hand-write the feed URLs.

## [1.11.0]

### Added

- **RSS feed card.** A lightweight, self-contained feed reader you can drop on
  any dashboard. Add one or more RSS/Atom feeds — each becomes a tab in the card
  header — with an optional combined **"All"** tab that merges every source
  newest-first. Choose between three layouts (**List** title + date, **Cards**
  with excerpt and thumbnail, or a **Compact** headlines view), cap how many
  items each feed shows, and set an auto-refresh interval (or 0 to refresh only
  when opened, plus a manual refresh button). Feeds are fetched through
  Obsidian's own request bridge (so cross-origin feeds work) and cached in
  memory, degrade gracefully offline (the last good items stay), and honour the
  **"disable external calls"** setting — with it on, no feed request is made.

### Fixed

- **Task date parsing no longer spams the console — and understands wikilink
  dates.** When a task's date field held something moment.js couldn't parse
  natively (e.g. `📅 [[260801]] #sd`, a due date written as a daily-note link),
  the parser fell back to moment's deprecated `new Date()` path, printing a
  loud RFC2822/ISO deprecation warning for every such field on every vault scan
  (#52). Dates are now parsed strictly (ISO first, then an explicit list of
  human formats), which can never trigger the warning. As part of the same
  change, date expressions may now be wrapped in a wikilink (`📅
  [[2026-08-01]]` or `[[Daily/2026-08-01|due]]` resolve to the linked day) and
  trailing `#tags` after a date are ignored (`📅 2026-08-01 #home`).

- **Settings pane no longer opens blank on Obsidian 1.13.** Root cause found
  (with an enormous assist from the affected users' console digging in #52):
  since the category-ribbon redesign, the settings tab had a private helper
  named `renderTab(body, tab)` — and Obsidian 1.13's reworked settings window
  calls an *internal, undocumented* `SettingTab.renderTab()` method (no
  arguments) as the entry point for opening a tab. Hearth's same-named helper
  silently shadowed it: Obsidian invoked it with no arguments, the
  `switch (undefined)` inside matched no category, and the pane rendered
  nothing — no error, on every reopen, on macOS and iPad alike (#52). And
  because Obsidian never got past that entry point, none of the earlier
  guards or the declarative registration could ever run. The helper is renamed
  so Obsidian's own machinery runs again, the tab additionally registers its
  pane through the 1.13 declarative settings API (older Obsidian versions keep
  using `display()` — same UI either way), and a constructor tripwire now
  reports any future member-name collision with Obsidian's `SettingTab`
  internals as a loud console error instead of a silent blank pane.
- **A failing settings section no longer blanks the whole settings pane.**
  Previously, if any part of the settings tab threw while rendering, the entire
  pane was left empty with nothing to explain why — and, because the tab
  remembers the last category you opened, it could stay blank on every reopen.
  The **entire** settings render is now guarded — each section, each tab, and
  the surrounding ribbon/datalist build — so a failure anywhere shows an inline
  error in its place and logs the underlying error to the developer console
  (including when Obsidian 1.13 renders settings in a separate window, whose
  console is easy to miss), instead of a silent blank pane. Whatever still
  works — sibling sections and the category ribbon — keeps working so you can
  navigate.
- **Orphaned file/folder bookmarks no longer linger in the Bookmarks card.**
  Obsidian keeps a file/folder bookmark in its store after the target note is
  deleted, and its native bookmarks pane hides those orphans; the Bookmarks card
  rendered the raw store, so a deleted note left a dead, unclickable row behind.
  File/folder bookmarks whose path no longer resolves are now filtered out,
  matching Obsidian's native behaviour. URL, search, and group items are
  unaffected.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **Hover-visibility options for dashboard controls.** The dashboard's
  arrange-mode zone and switcher can be set to reveal on hover instead of
  staying always visible, keeping the board clean until you reach for them; the
  hover hit-area is enlarged so they're easy to summon.
- **Per-dashboard search-bar visibility toggle.** Show or hide the search bar
  independently on each dashboard.
- **Base view selector for Embed cards.** An Embed card pointing at a `.base`
  file can choose which of the base's views it displays.

### Fixed

- **Invalid due dates no longer leak the text "Invalid date" into tasks.** A
  task due date that looked like an ISO date but wasn't a real calendar day —
  e.g. `📅 2026-02-31` (there's no 31st of February) or a month like `2026-13-01`
  — was being turned into the literal string **"Invalid date"** instead of being
  left alone. The validity check meant to reject such dates never ran (it tested
  moment's `isValid` as a property rather than calling it, so it was always
  truthy), so the bogus label was written straight into the tasks card. These
  dates are now correctly ignored, and any unparseable relative-date input falls
  back to showing the raw text verbatim, as intended. A silent bug — nothing
  errored, so it was easy to miss.
- **Hover-reveal controls no longer shift the board.** Switching a dashboard
  control to "Show on hover" added in-flow padding that only existed in hover
  mode, growing the control's zone by ~32px so it pushed the header and grid
  down — and in fit-to-page mode the extra height clipped the board. Hover mode
  now has the same footprint as always-visible mode, so revealing a control no
  longer moves anything.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-12

### Changed

- **Mobile action buttons: the legacy `commandId` field is migrated to
  `target`.** Buttons created before the unified command/note/URL model stored
  their action in a deprecated `commandId` field that was only read as a
  fallback. On load, such buttons are now migrated in place to the current
  `target` field and the result is written back to storage, so the legacy field
  finally leaves your `settings.json`. **This migration is one-way:** if you
  upgrade and then downgrade Hearth below this version, any mobile action button
  whose action was stored *only* as `commandId` loses its action (the button
  appears blank and must be reassigned). Buttons edited or created in a recent
  version are unaffected.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-11

A cards-and-appearance release aggregating the whole 1.7.1 beta series.

### Added

- **Dataview card** — runs a DQL or DataviewJS query and renders the results
  through [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)'s own
  renderers (tables, lists and task lists look native and refresh live), with
  auto-fitting, drag-resizable table columns.
- **Plugin view card** (beta) — hosts any plugin's — or a core — side-panel view
  (calendar, outline, tag pane, kanban…) right on the dashboard via a detached
  workspace leaf that never touches your saved layout.
- **Frosted glass** — a backdrop blur behind translucent cards at global,
  per-dashboard and per-card levels, drawn on one shared layer so merged cards
  read as a single seamless sheet. Now the default look for fresh installs.
- **About** settings tab.
- Embed cards can carry a **second view** with a switcher, and can **hide a
  base's header**.
- Tasks card gains a **list filter**, a **custom multi-rule sort**, and
  multi-value **TaskNotes "complete" statuses**.

### Changed

- **Settings tab reorganized** into a category ribbon (Appearance · Search ·
  Dashboard · Behaviour · Integrations · Backup · About) with a description on
  every setting.
- Embed **zoom now reflows** to fit its card.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-10

A major Tasks-card release, plus search and release-notes additions
(everything from the 1.6.8 beta series).

### Added

- **Kanban plugin boards** — the Tasks card can read and edit
  [Kanban](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-kanban) boards (each
  heading a column, each checkbox a card) as a list or a drag-and-drop board
  that rewrites the note in Kanban's own format.
- **Full obsidian-tasks metadata** — start (🛫), scheduled (⏳), due (📅) and
  done (✅) dates, a 5-level priority (🔺⏫🔼🔽⏬, each a distinct colour) and
  recurrence (🔁), shown as compact indicators with a right-click editor and
  add-card pickers — from Kanban cards and plain Markdown checkboxes alike.
- **Custom task states** (`[symbol] Label`) that each become a draggable board
  column, plus **done columns** and per-column **sort** (Smart / Due / Priority
  / Created / Alphabetical).
- **Quick view** — clicking a task opens a compact editor for metadata and
  description in place.
- **Convert to note** / **create as note** — turn a card into its own linked
  note (optionally from a template, scraping metadata into frontmatter), or
  create new cards as notes outright.
- **Omnisearch** — the search bar can optionally be powered by
  [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) when installed.
- **"What's new" dialog** — surfaces release notes from a continuous,
  accumulating changelog after each update.

### Changed

- Double-click **column rename**, clickable links, per-card descriptions, and
  card deletion on boards.
- Recurring tasks complete **per-occurrence** like TaskNotes.
- Scroll-mode boards grow as you drag a card past the bottom.

  ([1.5.2…1.6.1](https://github.com/ondreu/Hearth/compare/1.5.2...1.6.1)).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **Natural-language task dates** — type due/scheduled dates in plain language
  (`📅 tomorrow`, `📅 next friday`, `📅 in 3 days`…).
- **Free-form tiles** — tiles can be placed anywhere and may overlap; drag & drop
  with a dashed drop-target ghost and an overlap glow. Auto-shift is an opt-in
  beta per card.
- **Mobile search** — search optimized for mobile.
- **Edge-merging cards** — adjacent cards merge their borders and sharpen their
  touching corners so they read as one continuous tile.
- **Relative date labels for tasks** — Today / Tomorrow / Yesterday / Friday /
  Next Friday / "15 Jul".
- **Recurring-task completion checkbox** — undoable, rendered before the task
  text; Kanban recurring checkbox inline with the task text.
- **Hide titles** — hides card headers (not the dashboard header).

### Changed

- Daily/embed cards now use a single scrollbar; the embed scrolls instead of the
  card body.
- Daily note: floating open button on the card; header hidden by default in
  arrange mode.
- Manifest version is numeric-only (`1.6.0`) to satisfy Obsidian plugin review.
- Replaced direct `element.style.X = …` assignments with `setCssStyles()` / CSS
  classes; use `activeDocument` instead of `document` for popout-window
  compatibility; replaced CSS `:has(...)` selectors with explicit body modifier
  classes (`.is-embed-host`, `.is-jot-host`).

### Fixed

- Daily/embed horizontal scroll (clip x-overflow, wrap text).
- Tile drag offset (transform-based); overlap glow always on.
- Added the `u` flag to regexes containing surrogate-pair emoji (Tasks-plugin
  markers).

## [1.5.2] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- Maintenance and bug-fix release
  ([1.5.1…1.5.2](https://github.com/ondreu/Hearth/compare/1.5.1...1.5.2)).

### Fixed

- Maintenance and bug-fix release
  ([1.5.0…1.5.1](https://github.com/ondreu/Hearth/compare/1.5.0...1.5.1)).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-05

A redesigned dashboard experience, plus recurring tasks and many polish fixes.

### Added

- **CSS-grid tiles** — Links/launchpad and Commands tiles live on a fine CSS
  grid (44 px cells, 4 px snap) with independent column and row spans. Drag a
  tile to reorder; drag the corner grip to resize. Default tile is 2×2.
- **Ambient default background** — a soft, blurred backdrop ships out of the box.
- **Recurring TaskNotes tasks** — tasks with a `recurrence` RRULE show a ↻ badge
  next to the next-occurrence date, tinted with the accent colour, with a
  plain-English schedule tooltip ("Repeats every week"). Overdue recurring tasks
  tint like one-offs.
- **Overhauled starter dashboard** — a redesigned default layout with exact
  coordinates.

### Changed

- **Smarter task sorting** — due → scheduled → priority → created.
- **Kanban drop outlines** — dragged cards preview where they'll land.
- **Calendar today outline** — today's cell stays visible under the heatmap tint.
- **Search layout polish** — autocomplete click-outside, restored field width,
  larger tile grip.
- **Fit-to-page default-on** — fresh installs lock to one screen; stuck cards
  auto-recover onto the board on render.

### Fixed

- Card drag overlay behaves correctly over tile cards.
- Tile grip visibility and contrast improved.
- Calendar arrow targets now work in dark themes.
- "Other" file-type filter hides when there are no unmatched files.
- Default background uses a CDN URL (raw.githubusercontent was blocked by
  Obsidian's CSP).
