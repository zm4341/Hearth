![Hearth — customizable Obsidian dashboard, search and launcher](assets/Header.png)

**Hearth turns your Obsidian vault into a welcoming front page.** A fast fuzzy
search bar, quick file-type filters, and a freely arrangeable grid of live
widgets — notes, tasks, kanban boards, calendars, web pages, stats, clocks and
launchers — on desktop and mobile.

Think of it as a new-tab dashboard, start page and command launcher in one.

- 🔍 **Search everything** — fuzzy, full-text, tags, frontmatter and commands
- 🧩 **40+ cards** — embeds, tasks, calendars, Dataview, Git, Jira, Operon, and more
- 🔌 **26 integrations** — picked up automatically when the plugin is enabled
- 🎛️ **Free-form layout** — drag, resize and snap cards anywhere
- 🎨 **Two designs** — Classic, or Material 3 Expressive in tones of your accent
- 🪟 **Frosted glass** — per-card opacity, blur, color and corner radius
- 🗂️ **Multiple dashboards** — switch with a click or a hotkey
- 🪄 **Plugin view dashboards** — give a whole board to one plugin's view
- 📱 **Works on a phone** — the board stacks into one readable column

> **Looking for more detail?** The [Hearth User Guide](docs/user-guide/) is a
> full, chapter-by-chapter manual: every card, every setting, every integration,
> plus troubleshooting and a glossary. This README is the tour; the guide is the
> reference.

## Quick start

1. Install **Hearth** from Obsidian's community plugin browser — or drop
   `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` into
   `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/hearth/` and enable it.
2. Hearth opens on startup and replaces empty new tabs (both toggleable in
   **Settings → Hearth**).
3. Open it any time from the ribbon **home** icon or the **Open home
   dashboard** command.
4. Hit **Arrange** (top-right) to add, move, resize and configure cards right
   on the board.

## Setup wizard

On a fresh install Hearth offers to build your first dashboard for you, in
three steps: what the vault is for (with the plugins Hearth found), the look —
design, background and, for Classic, card style, each shown as a small
painting — and a preview of the board. It lays out a board from the answers
rather than dropping you on a generic starter grid: working cards in a main
column, small ones (clock, calendar, weather, statistics) beside them, and no
empty cards — anything that needs a feed or a place asks for it in the wizard.

It also **looks at what you already have**. Every plugin below that is installed
and enabled is offered with the one thing accepting it will do:

| Found | What Hearth does with it |
| --- | --- |
| **TaskNotes** | Adds a Tasks card on the TaskNotes source, using TaskNotes' *own* field names and completed statuses |
| **Kanban** | Adds a Tasks card showing your board as draggable columns |
| **Dataview** / **Datacore** | Adds a card, seeded with an editable query |
| **Templater** | Adds a launchpad with a button per template you already have |
| **Git** | Adds a Git card with status, commit and sync |
| **Operon** | Adds an Operon tasks card (desktop only — Operon still asks you to approve Hearth) |
| **Bases** | Embeds a base from your vault |
| **Daily notes** / **Bookmarks** | Adds the matching card |

The TaskNotes case is the one worth calling out: its field names are
user-remappable and its statuses user-defined, so Hearth reads them from the
plugin and copies them onto the card it builds. A vault that renamed `due` to
`deadline` gets a Tasks card that works on its first render.

The wizard offers the integrations above; everything else in
[Integrations](#integrations) is added by hand from the **Add card** picker.

**The wizard only ever writes to the dashboard it builds.** The title, its icon,
the accent, the card surface, the spacing and the background all land as
*per-board overrides* on that one dashboard, and the TaskNotes field mapping
lands on the Tasks card itself — so your vault-wide settings, and every other
board you have, come out of a setup run exactly as they went in. That is also
why it no longer asks about things that can only be vault-wide (whether Hearth
opens on startup, where notes open, which search engine to use, whose file
icons to show): those live in **Settings → Hearth**, one toggle each, and apply
to everything by design.

The last step previews the board — a scale drawing plus a list of every card and
why it's there — before anything is written. Nothing is applied until you press
**Build my dashboard**.

You can run it again any time from **Settings → Hearth → About → Build a
dashboard**, or the **Set up Hearth** command. Run that way it *always* adds a
new dashboard: every board you already have is left exactly as it is.

## Search

The search field is keyboard-first, with four transparent modes:

| Prefix | Mode | Matches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *(none)* | Fuzzy + full text | File names, tags, properties, and note bodies |
| `#` | Tags | Vault tags, showing which tag matched |
| `key:value` | Frontmatter | Notes whose property matches |
| `>` | Commands | Any registered command, run by name |

- **Auto-detected filters** — file-type chips built from what actually lives in
  your vault (notes, images, video, canvas, bases, Excalidraw…). Click one to
  list its items; hide the ones you don't need.
- **Recent files** appear in an empty, focused search field.
- **New note** button creates a note in your default location — or sends the
  query to a web search instead, if you'd rather. That button carries a small
  arrow: click it to search with **DuckDuckGo** (the default), **DuckDuckGo
  without AI**, **Brave**, **Kagi**, **Google**, **Mojeek**, **Ecosia** or
  **Qwant** for that one query. Which engine the button itself uses is
  **Settings → Appearance → Online search engine**.
- **Omnisearch engine** *(optional)* — swap the built-in engine for
  [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) under
  **Settings → Appearance → Search engine**.
- **Hide it** — **Settings → Appearance → Home → Show search section** turns
  the whole section off vault-wide, and each dashboard's **Search visibility**
  can follow that default or override it to show or hide the section on that
  board alone.

## Cards

Add cards from the **Arrange** toolbar; configure each one from the card itself
(title, content, colors, size, opacity, blur). **Add card** opens a searchable
picker — type to match a card's name or description, or browse by the
categories below. Cards backed by a community plugin are always listed, marked
*Needs Dataview* (or Git, Operon…) when the plugin isn't there, with a one-click
jump to install it. If the card you want doesn't exist, **Request a card** at
the bottom of the rail opens a pre-filled GitHub issue or email.

### Notes & files

| Card | What it shows | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Embedded note** | Any note, rendered live by Obsidian, with per-card zoom, optional in-place editing (raw or Live Preview) and a second view you can flip to | — |
| **Daily note** | Always today's note, created on first click | Daily notes (core) |
| **Periodic note** | Always the current week's, month's, quarter's or year's note, created on first click from your own template | [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) or [Journals](https://github.com/srg-kostyrko/obsidian-journal) |
| **Embedded image** | A picture from the vault — fill and crop, fit, stretch or scroll, anchored to any of nine points | — |
| **Slideshow** | Pictures from a list or a folder: on a timer, one a day (or every few days, worked out from the date) or only by hand, with captions, sort order, transition and length, slow zoom and hover controls | — |
| **Embedded canvas** | A canvas you can pan around in place | Canvas (core) |
| **Excalidraw drawing** | A drawing with native pan and zoom | [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) |
| **Embedded base** | A `.base` file, rendered by Obsidian's Bases | Bases (core) |
| **Recent files** | The files you opened most recently, as a list or tiles | — |
| **Folder** | What is in a folder, one level down, in the file explorer's own order — with a browser behind it: a breadcrumb, every subfolder opened one level, and any folder on the page steppable into | — |
| **Favorites** | The notes you starred in Hearth, as a list or tiles | — |
| **Bookmarks** | Your Obsidian bookmarks, with site favicons | Bookmarks (core) |

### Planning

| Card | What it shows | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tasks** | Markdown checkboxes, TaskNotes task notes or a [Kanban](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-kanban) board — as a list or a drag-and-drop board | — |
| **Calendar** | Month, week, day and list views over the same sources — plus Markdown checkbox tasks by their 📅 / ⏳ dates — with a scrolling time grid, overlapping-event columns and an all-day band | — |
| **Mini calendar** | A month grid or agenda with dots for existing notes, ISO week numbers and an edit heatmap | Daily notes (core) |
| **Clock & greeting** | Seven faces — digital, analogue, stacked, flip and rings, plus shapes and orbit in the Expressive design — custom date formats, optional playful greeting | — |

**Inside the Tasks card**

- **Kanban write-back** — drops are written in Kanban's own format, so the note
  stays editable in the Kanban plugin.
- **Dates & priorities** — full
  [obsidian-tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)
  marks (🔺⏫🔼🔽⏬ 🔁 🛫 ⏳ 📅 ✅), relative labels ("Today", "Next Friday"),
  natural-language input (`📅 in 3 days`), and per-occurrence completion for
  recurring tasks.
- **Sorting & filtering** — smart chain (due → scheduled → priority → created)
  or a custom multi-rule sort, per list and per Kanban column; filter by status,
  priority or tag, on the list and on the Kanban board alike.
- **Tags & descriptions** — `#tags` show as chips, and lines indented under a
  checkbox show (and edit) as the task's description.
- **Custom task fields** *(opt-in)* — name a field, pick how it's drawn (chip,
  dot, text, row tint or glow), and map any frontmatter or built-in key to
  labels and colors. Click a value to change it.
- **Quick view** — click a task for a compact popover with editable metadata and
  description instead of jumping into the note.

**Inside the calendars** — both follow your locale's week start and clock by
default; week start, hidden weekends, week numbers, drawn hours and hour height
are all yours to set. Mini calendar also subscribes to external **ICS/iCal**
feeds, reads **TaskNotes** (scheduled, due, recurrences, timeblocks) and
**Operon** due dates, and creates a note from any event, linked back by ID.

### Vault insight

| Card | What it shows | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Query** | A saved search, kept live | — |
| **Search bar** | A search field on the board, framed or bare | — |
| **Vault statistics** | Notes, attachments, folders, tags and daily-note streak | — |
| **Activity heatmap** | A year of vault activity, day by day — or, in advanced mode, any metric you define: a frontmatter date, a summed property, your own rules | — |

### Tools

| Card | What it shows | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Links / launchpad** | A grid of buttons opening notes, URLs or commands, each with its own column and row span, filling the card or fixed in pixels | — |
| **Commands** | Buttons that run any command-palette command | — |
| **Text / jot-down** | A quick Markdown scratchpad saved with the card | — |
| **Calculator** | Math, unit conversions, number bases (`FF hex to decimal`), live currency and plain-language queries (`20% of 150`), with an optional keypad | Network for rates |
| **Web page** | Any `http(s)` URL in a sandboxed iframe, optionally auto-refreshed | Network |

### Integration cards

Categorized as **Integrations** in the picker.

| Card | What it shows | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **New note from template** | Buttons that each make a note from a Templater template, in a folder and filename pattern you pick | [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) |
| **Dataview query** | A DQL or DataviewJS query, rendered by Dataview's own live renderers, with resizable table columns | [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) |
| **Datacore query** | A Datacore query, or a full JS/JSX/TS/TSX script rendered by Datacore's views | [Datacore](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore) |
| **Git** | Branch, staged and changed files, unpushed commits and recent log, with commit / sync / push / pull / stage / discard buttons and per-file diffs | [Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) |
| **Jira filter** | Issues from a saved Jira filter or JQL search, filtered by status, assignee, priority, type, sprint and version | Jira over HTTPS |
| **RSS feed** | Headlines from any RSS 2.0 or Atom feed you follow | Network |
| **Weather** | Current conditions and forecast from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) in seven styles, up to an edge-to-edge painted sky that follows real conditions and time of day, tonight's moon in its real phase (*Moon*) and the sun's arc from sunrise to sunset (*Daylight*) — click a card for the full forecast, hour by hour | Network |
| **Markets** | Stocks, ETFs, funds, indices, forex and crypto from most of the world's exchanges — Chinese on- and off-exchange funds included — as a single price, a spotlight with a chart, an edge-to-edge chart, a watchlist, tiles, a ticker tape, a portfolio with gains in one currency, or a search field on the card. Classic or Material 3 Expressive; red-up or green-up. Click anything for the full chart and stats | Network |
| **World tension** | Kagi News' [World Tension index](https://kite.kagi.com/?view=chaos) — a language model's 0–100 reading of the day's world news — as a minimal reading on a scale, or an edge-to-edge diorama of a village that goes from peace to war as the score climbs. Classic or Material 3 Expressive; the model's explanation, the change since yesterday and a sparkline are optional | Network |
| **Operon tasks / board / agenda / timer** | Four cards on [Operon](https://github.com/hasanyilmaz/operon)'s own API — a task list, a pipeline board, a few days' agenda, and the running time tracker | Operon (desktop) |
| **Plugin view** *(beta)* | Another plugin's side-panel view (calendar, outline, tag pane, Kanban…) hosted in a card, optionally pinned to one file | A plugin with a view |

The Templater card does something Templater's own per-template commands can't:
the same template can feed three different folders from three different
buttons. Templater still does the templating — user scripts,
`tp.system.prompt()` dialogs and `tp.file.cursor()` placement all behave as they
do from its own command.

Git and Operon both work *through* the other plugin rather than around it: Git
commits go through the Git plugin's own task queue, so your remote, credentials
and commit-message template apply unchanged, and Hearth never parses Operon's
notes. See [Operon](#operon) for its setup, which is the one that needs a step
from you.

### Fun

| Card | What it shows | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pet** | A pixel-art companion (cat, dog, bird, fox, frog or blob) whose mood follows your vault — content, happy, bored, or asleep on a quiet day, with drawn animation and eyes that follow your pointer. Set a night window, name it, color it. Nothing to lose; clicking it earns hearts | — |
| **Vault Pet** | The [Vault Pet](https://github.com/elliott-json-park/obsidian-vault-pet) plugin's own pet, living on the board: its card (sprite, level, streak, click to pet) or its whole house — quests, dex, badges, wardrobe and stats | [Vault Pet](https://github.com/elliott-json-park/obsidian-vault-pet) |

Everything is **live**: embeds and editable notes follow vault events without
losing your cursor, data cards redraw on vault and metadata changes, and web
cards refresh on a timer. Everything that reaches the network respects
**Settings → Behaviour → Disable external calls** — every card, and a background
image or title icon given as a web address.

## Integrations

Hearth picks these up on its own — nothing to connect, no keys to paste. The
full list, with live status and where each one's settings live, is under
**Settings → Hearth → Integrations**.

**Community plugins**

network → Disable external calls**.

| Service | Used by | Account / key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) | Weather cards and the live weather sky | None. Only the coordinates you pick are sent, and a pinned sky needs no location at all |

| DuckDuckGo, Brave, Kagi, Google, Mojeek, Ecosia, Qwant | The search bar's optional web-search button, whichever engine you pick for it | None |
| Whatever host you name | A background image or title icon given as a web address | None |

### Operon

The four Operon cards read through Operon's own in-process developer API, so
recurrence, statuses and completion stay Operon's to define. Filters are
pickers over what Operon actually has — pipeline, status, priority, completion,
note or text — or you can hand the whole question over to one of Operon's own
scopes (*Happening today*, *Overdue*, *Recently touched*). Clicking a task
opens its note on the exact line.

**Reading is the default; changing is a choice.** Switch on *Allow changes*
(**Settings → Hearth → Integrations → Operon**) and the board card lets you drag
a task into another status column — or pick one from the row's right-click menu,
so it works without a mouse — and every card grows a **+** that creates a task
where Operon's own settings say new tasks go. Hearth previews the change,
Operon rates it and applies it, and anything more than routine is confirmed with
you first. A move carries the status the board was drawn from, so a drag onto a
stale board is refused rather than quietly undoing someone else's change. Leave
the switch off and Hearth can only read.

Before you add one:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Platform** | Desktop only, Obsidian 1.12.2 or newer |
| **Approval** | Hearth's request appears in **Settings → Operon → Core → General → Developer API Integrations** — approve it there. Until then the cards say what they're waiting for |
| **Widening it** | Operon grants all-or-nothing, so turning *Allow changes* on needs a fresh approval |
| **Status & kill switch** | **Settings → Hearth → Integrations** shows the connection, what was requested, and how to cut it |

## Layout

- **Free-form drag & resize** — move cards anywhere and resize from any edge or
  corner, with magnetic snapping to neighbours and the board.
- **Edge-merging** — snap two cards together and their shared border drops out,
  so the pair reads as one continuous tile.
- **Multiple dashboards** — a `[1] [2] [+]` switcher in the top-left. Name each
  board, give it an emoji or a Lucide icon, reorder by dragging, and override
  the global width, columns, row height, background and title icon per board.
  Open a board's settings from **Dashboard settings** in the **Arrange**
  toolbar or by right-clicking its switcher button.
- **Plugin view dashboards** — set a board's **Dashboard type** to **Plugin
  view** and it stops being a grid of cards: the whole board becomes one
  plugin's view — your RSS reader, a Kanban board, a Canvas, the outline — at
  full size and fully working, with the switcher, header and background still
  around it. So the reader you check twenty times a day is one click from your
  task board rather than a tab you have to find your way back from.

  Pick the view on the board's **Plugin view** tab. The list is every view the
  app has registered right now, Obsidian's own document surfaces included
  (Markdown, PDF, image, audio, video) — a full board has the room and a file
  picker beside the type picker, so a specific note, drawing or PDF can *be* a
  dashboard. You can also hide the hosted view's breadcrumb header, and let it
  take focus so the plugin's own commands and hotkeys find it (experimental —
  Obsidian may then open a clicked note into it).

  **Edge to edge.** The hosted view gets the whole pane — no page gutter, no
  card frame, no toolbar row — and the only chrome left is the switcher strip
  across the top with the board's settings gear at the end of it. The title and
  search start hidden for the same reason; all of it is an ordinary per-board
  override you can switch back on.

  **Switching is instant.** A plugin board stays loaded while another board is
  showing instead of reloading from cold; up to three are kept warm at a time,
  and a heavy plugin can opt out per board under **Keep running in the
  background**. The board keeps its cards, so turning it back into a **Cards**
  board brings them back untouched.
- **Pinned cards** — pin a card to appear on every dashboard, sharing one
  definition and position.
- **Fit to page** — lock the board to one screen or let it scroll.
- **Import / export** — share one dashboard as a file that looks the same in
  someone else's vault (wallpaper optionally carried inside it), signed with an
  anonymous handle Hearth makes for you that nobody else can publish under, with
  one switch to leave your note paths, calendar links and location out of it —
  or back up every board and setting as JSON.
- **Dashboard gallery** — browse boards other people have published, by
  category, search or rating, install one in a click and leave a comment;
  publish your own — with a picture of the board, its every word blanked out
  before the screenshot is taken — from the same dialog you export from, with your paths and private feeds removed and
  the file signed so nobody can publish under your handle. Every upvote you get
  adds up on your profile. Nothing is fetched until you open the gallery and
  nothing is sent until you publish, and clearing the address in settings turns
  it off for good. Anybody can [run their own](docs/gallery-hosting.md): the
  server is in this repository and starts with one Docker command.

## Appearance

- **Design: Classic or Material 3 Expressive** — Expressive redraws everything
  Hearth draws in tonal steps of your accent color, in light and dark themes:
  opaque tonal cards with large rounded corners, grouped lists, pills and
  button groups, and the same look on the search row, dialogs, menus and
  Hearth's settings. Obsidian's own interface is left to your theme. The choice
  cascades vault → board → card (**Settings → Hearth → Appearance → Design**).
- **Terminal mode** — the third design: all of Hearth as a text interface, the
  way `htop` looks. One character grid in a bundled monospaced font, cards as
  box-drawn frames that join their neighbours, tasks as tables, notes as
  highlighted Markdown you can tick and edit, calendars as `cal`, the weather
  as ASCII art, charts in block characters, folders as trees — and keys for
  everything (Tab between cards, arrows inside, `m` the card menu, `z` zoom,
  F1–F10 for the board). Five colour schemes, one of them your theme's.
- **Background** — solid color, vault image, URL, a background **drawn by
  Hearth** (*Hearth default* — hills and a cabin, or Material's soft shapes in
  Expressive — and *Harbour town*, both following your light or dark theme and
  never going online), or a **live weather sky**:
  the board's backdrop becomes the painted sky the weather card's artistic style
  draws, spread across the whole window and following the real conditions and
  time of day over a place you pick. Or pin one sky — clear night, snow,
  thunder — and keep it whatever the weather is doing, which needs no location
  and never goes online. All with opacity and blur. Ships with a soft ambient
  default.
- **Banner or full background** — wear that same backdrop either way: filling
  the whole view, or as a **banner** across the top of the board, the way a
  cover image sits above a note, with the cards below it on your theme's own
  surface. Set the height, fade the lower edge into the page, and choose whether
  it lines up with the content or runs edge to edge — each a per-board override,
  so one dashboard can show the vault's background as a banner while the next
  keeps it as a wallpaper.
- **Frosted glass** — card opacity and backdrop blur at three levels (global →
  per-dashboard → per-card). Merged cards blur as one seamless sheet.
- **Card corner radius** — from the default 14 px down to sharp 0 px.
- **Per-card colors** — an accent and a background tint for any card.
- **Title, title icon and compact spacing** for the dashboard header.
- **Its own search row and chrome** — a dashboard can set its own search
  placeholder, its own button beside the search field (or none), its own filter
  chips, whether it stacks into one column when narrow, whether the arrange
  button and the switcher stay visible or fade in on hover, and whether the
  painted sky drifts. Each follows the vault until the board says otherwise, and
  each travels with the board when you export it.
- **One title icon, four ways to set it** — the mark beside the board's heading
  takes a **Lucide icon** (searched from a picker rather than typed from
  memory), an **emoji or a couple of characters**, the **vault path of an
  image**, or the **URL of an image on the web**. Each dashboard can override
  it; leave it empty and the Hearth crystal stays as it was. Hearth's **tab and
  ribbon** button takes a Lucide icon of its own.

## Mobile

Hearth's board is laid out freely — cards sit where you drop them, at a
fraction of the board's width. Below **700px** by default that stops meaning
anything, so the board **reflows into a single full-width column**, top to
bottom, in the order the desktop board reads in. Your layout is never
rewritten: the same board is a launcher on your phone and a wall of cards on
your monitor.

The threshold is the **measured width of the board**, not the platform — so a
narrow desktop pane gets the same treatment, and you can see the phone layout
by dragging a pane narrow.

- **Stacked column** — cards full width, one per row. Turn it off in
  **Settings → Hearth → Mobile** to keep the free-form layout, or move the
  threshold with **Narrow below** (vault-wide, or per board in
  **Dashboard settings → Layout**).
- **Per-card overrides** — in a card's settings (Layout → *On a narrow board*):
  **hide** it, give it a **position** in the column, set its **height**, or
  **start it collapsed** as a title row that builds the card only when tapped —
  so an expensive card costs one row until you open it.
- **Phone preview** — hit **Arrange → Preview at phone width** to build and
  check your phone board without a phone, inside a drawn phone so the
  proportions read properly. While stacked, drag a card's bottom edge to set
  its height, and use the move up / move down buttons in its header to reorder.
- **Edge to edge** — the side gutters go, the safe-area insets stay; filter
  chips and search results grow to 44px tap targets.
- **Full-width search** — the chips and results span the screen instead of the
  search bar's share of it, and the button beside the field drops to an icon.
- **Its own performance tier** — defaults to *Balanced* on mobile; your desktop
  tier is stored separately and untouched.
- **Its own settings category** — everything above lives under
  **Settings → Hearth → Mobile**.
- **Mobile mode** — still there: an optional search-only launcher, if that is
  all you want on a phone.
- **Action bar** — a row of buttons under the search field (New note, New
  drawing, Record voice, Open daily note by default), each swappable for any
  command.
- **Keyboard-aware** — the visible area tracks the on-screen keyboard.

## Settings & shortcuts

Everything lives under **Settings → Hearth**, grouped by a category ribbon:
**Appearance**, **Search**, **Dashboard**, **Behaviour** (startup, new tabs,
where notes open, mobile, privacy), **Integrations**, **Backup** and **About**.
Per-card settings are edited from the card itself in arrange mode.

Bindable under **Settings → Hotkeys**:

- **Open home dashboard**
- **Switch to dashboard 1…9** — changes the active board
- **Open dashboard 1…9** — changes it *and* brings Hearth up, so jumping to a
  particular board from anywhere in the vault is one shortcut
- **Switch to next / previous dashboard**

In the search field: `↑`/`↓` to move, `Enter` to open, `Esc` to dismiss.

## Privacy & network

Hearth has **no telemetry, no analytics and no ads**, and it never sends your
notes anywhere. Out of the box it makes no network requests at all: every call
below happens only because you added the card, typed the query or opened the
screen that needs it, and **Settings → Behaviour → Disable external calls**
switches all of them off at once.

| What you use | Who it contacts | What is sent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Weather** card | `api.open-meteo.com`, `geocoding-api.open-meteo.com` | The coordinates or place name you set |
| **Markets** card | `query1/query2.finance.yahoo.com`, `api.coingecko.com`, `qt.gtimg.cn`, `web.ifzq.gtimg.cn`, `smartbox.gtimg.cn`, `fundgz.1234567.com.cn`, `fund.eastmoney.com`, `api.frankfurter.app` | The symbols on your watchlist or the name you search for |
| **World tension** card | `kite.kagi.com` | Nothing but the request for today's index (and its history, if the card shows it) |
| **Calculator** card and currency answers in search | `api.frankfurter.app` | Nothing but the request for today's rates |
| `wiki …` answers in search | `<language>.wikipedia.org` | The term you look up |
| **RSS feed**, **Mini calendar** (ICS/iCal), **Web page** cards | Only the addresses you enter | A plain request for that feed, calendar or page |
| **Jira filter** card | Only the Jira instance you enter | Your filter or JQL, with the token you enter on the card |
| **Bookmarks** card, URL bookmarks | `www.google.com/s2/favicons` | The bookmark's domain, to fetch its icon |
| **Dashboard gallery** (browse, import, publish) | `gallery.o-uhnavy.com`, or the gallery server you set | What you choose to publish; browsing sends only the search |
| A background image or title icon given as a web address | That address | A plain request for the image |

Links in the settings and in *What's new* (GitHub issues, Ko-fi) open in your
browser only when you click them.

**Your vault.** Search, the statistics and heatmap cards and the tasks cards
list the files in your vault and read notes to show them on the board. That
stays on your device. Hearth writes to your vault only when you act: a note
created from a card or template, a checkbox ticked, an event note, an imported
picture.

**Clipboard.** Hearth writes to the clipboard when you press a copy button (an
instant answer, a publishing key). It never reads the clipboard.

## Disclaimer

This plugin was created using AI.

All PRs are tested in a testing vault by a human before merging, and all
releases are beta tested in a testing vault by a human before being promoted to
stable.

## Development

```bash
npm install      # install dependencies
npm run dev      # watch build -> main.js
npm run build    # typecheck + production build
npm run typecheck
```

To test in a vault, symlink or copy `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css`
into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/hearth/`.

**Translations** — Hearth speaks English, Simplified Chinese, German and French,
following Obsidian's display language. User-facing strings live in
[`src/locales/`](src/locales/). English (`en.ts`) is the source of truth; copy
it, translate the values and register the file. See [`src/locales/README.md`](src/locales/README.md).

## Contributing

Hearth moves fast, so the most valuable contributions right now are **bug
reports**, **feature ideas** and **translations**. Small, obvious fixes are
always welcome; for anything larger, please open an issue first — big PRs
against a fast-moving codebase tend to go stale. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Support

Hearth is free and open source. If it's earned a place on your vault's front
page, you can buy me a coffee — it genuinely helps keep the updates coming.
