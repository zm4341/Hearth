 * The size and position a single button carries inside a launchpad-like card

 * three cards run the same grid, the same drag and the same resize.
 *
 * There are two generations of sizing, kept side by side so a card can switch
 * between them without losing either:
 *
 * - **Fixed (legacy).** `sizeW`/`sizeH` are pixels: the button is that big
 *   whatever the card's size, so widening the card only fits more buttons in.
 * - **Scaled.** `spanW`/`spanH` count cells of the card's own grid (see
 *   `DashboardCard.tileCols`), so a button is a *fraction of the card* and
 *   grows with it — the way a card grows with the dashboard. They move in
 *   halves, since the grid is drawn at half-cell resolution, so a button can be
 *   half a cell wide, half a cell tall, or both.
 *
 * Which pair is read is decided by the card's `tileSizing`; the other is left
 * untouched, so turning the legacy style back on restores the old sizes
 * exactly. A tile with no `spanW`/`spanH` yet derives them from its pixel size
 * on read, so a card flipped to the scaled style keeps its rough proportions;
