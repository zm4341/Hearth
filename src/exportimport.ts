/**
 * The dialogs around the portable-package engine: export a board, import a
 * file, back up and restore a vault.
 *
 * Everything about *what* travels lives in `src/portable/`; this file is the
 * two conversations that wrap it.
 *
 * On the way out there are only two questions worth asking, because everything
 * else about a board is not a choice: the cards' settings, the cards pinned to
 * every board, the notes a favourites card shows — all of it is part of what is
 * on screen, and none of it is something a dashboard shows you a difference
 * between, so all of it simply travels. What is left is whether the pictures
 * ride along, and whether the author's private things are left out. A
 * disclosure below them tunes each group of that separately and *lists the
 * values*, so "leave out my private information" can be checked rather than
 * trusted — and it is built only when it is opened.
 *
 * Who the file is by is not a question either. A typed name is personal data
 * Hearth has no reason to hold and a label anybody can claim, so the dialog
 * shows an anonymous handle derived from a key that never leaves the vault
 * (`src/identity.ts`) and offers to copy or replace that key.
 *
 * On the way in the question is what you are about to get. A downloaded board
 * routinely mentions notes you haven't got and plugins you haven't installed,
 * so the import dialog reads the file first and says what it found, what it
 * needs and what is missing, *before* anything is applied — and then adds the
 * board rather than replacing your vault, which is what makes importing a
 * stranger's dashboard a safe thing to do at all.

 * the same on every export, and not something a stranger can publish under.
 * See `src/identity.ts`.

 * The handle is the point of the row, so it is *shown* rather than mentioned

 * explanation.
 *

 * states want different things:
 *
 * - **None yet** — one button that makes one, and one that pastes in a key from
 *   another install. There is nothing to copy.
 * - **One already** — copy the key (the thing worth doing before it is needed)
 *   and replace it. No "generate", because generating over an identity is
 *   throwing one away, and the thing that does that is called "use a different
 *   key" and asks first.
 *
 * `decorate` adds a control ahead of the buttons — the share dialog puts its
 * "include this" switch there. `onChanged` is called after the identity changes,
 * since the handle on screen is then the wrong one. `mint` mints silently for a
 * caller that is about to *use* the identity; see {@link vaultIdentity}.
