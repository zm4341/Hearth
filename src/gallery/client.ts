/**
 * Talking to a gallery server.
 *
 * One class, one host, and a hard line about what crosses it: Hearth sends a
 * package, a vote and a signature over a nonce. It never sends the recovery
 * key, and there is no code path here that could — `signMessage` takes the key
 * and returns a signature, and only the signature is ever put in a body. That
 * is the constraint `docs/dashboard-package.md` asks a gallery to honour, and
 * it is honoured on this side by not having the wire to send it down.
 *
 * Requests go through Obsidian's `requestUrl` rather than `fetch`, for the same
 * reason the RSS and weather cards do: it is not subject to the renderer's CORS
 * rules, so a self-hosted gallery does not have to grow an `Access-Control-*`
 * policy for a client that isn't a browser page. It also means a request cannot
 * be made to carry the vault's cookies, because there aren't any.
 *
 * Everything that comes back is read through `types.ts`. Nothing in this file
 * hands a raw response to a caller.
