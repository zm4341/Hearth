/**
 * The dashboard gallery: browsing what other people have published, installing
 * one, and publishing your own.
 *
 * The engine lives here; the three modals that use it are `src/gallerybrowse.ts`
 * and `src/gallerydetail.ts`, and publishing shares the export dialog in
 * `src/exportimport.ts`.
 *
 * - `categories.ts` the closed list of what a board is *for*.
 * - `contents.ts`   what is on a board, by card kind.
 * - `types.ts`      the wire shapes, and the validators every response goes
 *                   through.
 * - `client.ts`     one host, and the only place a request is made.
 * - `install.ts`    a downloaded entry, handed to the importer unchanged.
 * - `publish.ts`    an export, stripped and signed, handed to a host.
 * - `published.ts`  which entry each board this vault published became.
 *
 * Nothing about the gallery is required for Hearth to work, and nothing here
 * runs unless a host is configured: no host means the buttons say so and stop,
 * rather than reaching out to somewhere by default. That is deliberate — a
 * vault should not talk to a server because a plugin shipped with one in a
 * constant.
