/**
 * The design Hearth's own interface is drawn in — its dialogs, menus, settings
 * pane and the board's furniture — as opposed to the cards, which already had
 * one (see effectiveCardDesign).
 *
 * The rule is the cards' rule, carried outwards: a card's design, else its
 * board's, else the vault's Card design. What makes it work for a dialog is
 * knowing where the dialog was opened *from*, and a dialog is almost always
 * opened by a click or a keystroke a moment earlier. So Hearth remembers the
 * element the last press landed on, and a dialog or menu built shortly after
 * takes the design of the nearest thing around that element that states one:
 *
 *  - a card, which carries its own effective design (`data-hearth-design`,
 *    written in dashboard.ts);
 *  - the board, which carries the board's (view.ts);
 *  - another Hearth dialog or menu, which carries whatever it was given — so a
 *    confirm opened from a dialog looks like that dialog;
 *  - the settings pane, which carries the vault's.
 *
 * Anything else — the command palette, a ribbon button, a press too long ago
 * to be the one that opened this — falls back to the vault's design.
 *
 * A caller that knows better still says so: {@link dressModal} in ui.ts
 * overrides the default, which is how a task, an event or a folder dialog has
 * always taken the design of the card it came from.
