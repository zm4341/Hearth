/**
 * The catalogue of everything Hearth talks to: community plugins, Obsidian's
 * own core plugins, and the external services a few cards fetch from.
 *
 * Why a catalogue at all — Hearth's integrations are, by nature, scattered.
 * Some carry global settings (TaskNotes' field names, the Iconic/Iconize
 * switch), some are a single option on a different tab (Omnisearch is a choice
 * in the search-engine dropdown), and most are configured per-card on the board
 * or need no configuration whatsoever. Before this, that meant the Integrations
 * tab showed only the two integrations that happened to have settings, and
 * there was nowhere to answer "what does Hearth work with, and is it working
 * right now?".
 *
 * So the catalogue is deliberately *complete and static*: every entry is listed
 * whether or not the plugin is installed and whether or not Hearth has a
 * setting for it. Status is resolved live at render time; the row says where
 * the setting lives (or that there isn't one) either way.
 *
 * Everything here is pure data plus one resolver, so it is unit-testable and
 * carries no rendering concerns — {@link HomeSettingTab} renders it.
