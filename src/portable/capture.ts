/**
 * Building a package: what travels, and how a board is made self-describing.
 *
 * The interesting work here is one idea. A dashboard's look is only half stored
 * on the dashboard — the other half is the vault's global settings, which the
 * board falls back to for anything it doesn't override. Carry the board alone
 * and it arrives wearing the *importer's* half: their grid, their card opacity,
 * their wallpaper, their search placeholder. So before a board is written into a
 * `dashboard` package, every look-affecting setting is resolved and written onto
 * the board itself. The board stops inheriting and starts stating.
 *
 * That resolution goes through Hearth's own `effective*()` readers rather than a
 * copy of their rules, by handing them a snapshot of the settings whose active
 * board is the one being exported. Two things fall out of it for free: the
 * plugin-board special cases (a hosted view hides the title and fills the pane
 * unless told otherwise) come across correctly, and there is no second copy of
 * the fallback logic to drift out of step with the first.
 *
 * The snapshot is also **tier-neutralised**, and that is not a detail. The
 * performance tier overrides the frosted glass and the wallpaper *at read time*
 * without touching what is stored, so exporting what the resolvers say on a
 * phone at `balanced` would bake "no blur, flat grey backdrop" into the file
 * permanently — the author's real board, lost to a device setting. The snapshot
 * therefore pins the tier to `full` before asking, so what is captured is what
 * the author configured. The tier they were actually on is recorded in
 * `capture.performanceTier` as information, never applied on import.

 * every board in the importer's vault. `pinned` is therefore cleared — the copy
 * is this board's card now, and it is free to be pinned or not on its own.
 *
 * A plugin board is the exception, and only because it renders no cards at all —
 * asked through `isFullBoard`, which is what the renderer asks. A single-card
 * board is the same exception: it renders its one card and no pinned ones. The board's
 * `mode` is the answer; `pluginView` is kept when a board is switched back to

 * so reading that instead would drop the pinned cards from an ordinary board
