/**
 * Every place a package can point at something outside itself.
 *
 * A dashboard is not self-contained. It names notes and folders in the author's
 * vault, images it wants painted, calendar feeds only the author can read, a
 * town whose weather it shows, commands and view types that only exist when the
 * right plugins are installed. Three jobs need to know exactly where those
 * values live, and all three read the one table below:
 *
 * 1. **Reporting.** What does this package need, and what of the author's vault
 *    does it mention? An import dialog and a gallery listing both ask this.
 * 2. **Stripping.** A gallery is handed a package and must be able to remove
 *    the author's vault paths and private feeds before publishing it, keeping
 *    the layout, the styling and the embedded pictures. That is
 *    {@link stripReferences}, and it is the reason this table is a table rather
 *    than thirty `if` branches spread across the exporter.
 * 3. **Checking.** On import, which of the paths actually exist here? Each miss
 *    becomes a warning naming the path, rather than a card that silently shows
 *    nothing.
 *
 * The table is a denylist, so a gap in it means a value travels that perhaps
 * shouldn't. {@link residualPaths} is the backstop: after stripping, it sweeps
 * whatever is left for strings that still look like vault paths or feed URLs
 * and reports them, so a card kind added without a rule here shows up as a
 * finding instead of a leak.
 *
 * **Adding a card kind:** if its config names a note, folder, attachment,
 * private URL, command or view type, add a rule for it below.
