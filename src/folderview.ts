/**
 * The folder browser as a tab of its own (#375).
 *
 * The dialog over the board is a good way to look into a folder and get back
 * to the board; it is a poor place to spend time in one — it covers the board,
 * caps its height, and is gone the moment a note is opened. A tab has the whole
 * page, survives a reload on the folder it was showing, and walks its folders
 * through the tab's own back and forward buttons.
 *
 * The browser itself is the dialog's (`FolderBrowser` in `cards/folder.ts`):
 * this view only hosts it — persists its state, names the tab, and redraws it
 * when the folder it shows changes on disk, which the dialog, opened for a
 * moment, never needed to.
